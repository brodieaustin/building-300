# Chapter 1: The Building #

No road or path led her to Building 300. There were no roads and no paths then, just the broken, faded outlines of them. Just her feet tromping through the brush, the weedy grasses and plants like brushes that only painted brown. Even now, huddled in Building 300 she could hear the crunch and pad of her steps, so many steps that took her from here to there.

It wasn't worth remembering what here had been. There was no here there anymore. No one had here to recall. She certainly didn't. Here wasn't something to wrap herself up in to keep warm now that night was stalking day with its dark and cold. There was here now. And here was Building 300.

The waves outside the building never lapped, only roared. They roared from far away; they roared from up close. The roar was always the same. A long inhale and a ferocious exhale as water swept up over sand, rocks, metal, and debris. She could hear the waves now, getting closer, seemingly pulling the land down into its depths. Soon, the water would  swallow up her footpaths. The close ones to the water that made foraging for food a little easier.

She shivered as the newly cold air crept in through the buildings large metallic grate. She was too tired to do much about it. But tomorrow, that would be her project. So she crouched in the far corner of the low rectangular building and pressed her body close to the concrete walls that still emanated whatever heat those thick walls had absorbed from whatever pittance of sunshine was left outside.

The next morning, she woke with a chill damp feeling all over her, yet her body strangely burning and hot. Everything was odd contrasts now. Restlessness that wouldn't give way to fatigue; fever spells that left her freezing. The world emptied of everything and yet full of threat.

She stood and stretched and tried to follow some semblance of an exercise regime. The regime was just broken phrasing of poses and positions she mechanically enacted, as if re-running a buffer of routines. She rummaged through her tattered box of rations--really just broken bits of food collected along the way. Most of the crackers and bars and snacks were stale, but a few dry, tasteless crumbs was enough to push hunger back.

The only working door squealed as she shouldered it open, the door's bottom scraping and catching on at the bottom with each shove. Once she stepped out onto the loose sandy outside, she shouldered the door back.

There was nothing of real value in the building, but the building itself. So she didn't secure the building in any meaningful way. Tucked at the base of a ravine and long the shoreline, the building wasn't there to be noticed.

She walked to the side of the building with the large metal grate and examined it. The side angled inwards, which gave the small building an angular trapezoidal appearance. The grate was taller than her and surrounded by broken pipes and conduit.

She ran her hands along the angled vents of the grates. She peered through one at eye level, spying on the intimate emptiness inside the building. It pleased her that there was hardly any evidence of anyone living there. That seemed right.

Standing there, she considered her options. She could pack the vents with mud to create insulation. But when the weather warmed up would the building be stifling inside. She had only found the building within the last days...weeks...months. She wasn't very sure, but the weather had already been breezy and cooling by the time she found it and took shelter there.

The only thing to do would do insulate from the inside. She scanned the ridgeline of the ravine above the building. Thinning trees and dying brush darted and raced along the edge of the drop to the water's edge. She would go up there to collect the leaves and branches she would need to build her shelter within a shelter.

She picked her way along the broken remains of a path, most the pieces had been washed with lake mud and brushed with sand. This probably had been a leisure path at some time. Families would come here with their strollers. She passed a twisted rusty bike frame lodged in mud further down the shore. A relic of a world she could barely remember anymore.

A old black trash bag rustled in the breeze, caught in the bramble of bushes. She fished it out. It was still intact enough to hold whatever materials she needed to transport back to the building. She waded up the bag and shoved it under the puff of her outermost vest.

At some point, an imposing staircase had been built to draw visitors down to the water's edge. The staircase once had stood confidently on the face of the ravine, twisting and turning into a series of landings. Now the structure clung to the ravine face, tilting and swaying as it stood there.

She had passed this way many times. She liked to look at the faded remnants of a mural that had been painted on the concrete base that supported the stairs. Root systems and branches and leaves sprawled out luxuriously against undulating fields of orange and blue.

Her fingers grazed the length of the painted mural before she started her climb up the stairs. The structure groaned as she put her weight on it. She had found during a the only other time she climbed it that using the outside structure was safer. That other time a step had given way under her weight. The thick beams that made up the structure was less likely to rot away.

By the time she reached the top of the staircase, she could feel the sweat from her skin working hard to cool her down, even as her layers of clothing fought to keep in what little heat they could.

At the top of the stairs, a broken piece of signage caught her eye off to the right. What remained of the tree cover was thicker there so she headed that way. As she picked her way through the brush, she couldn't help but feel very exposed up above. The cloud cover was thick and heavy, as it usually was. Even under the thick grey shield, she felt a now instinctive need to find cover.

But she wanted to see what the sign was and what it pointed out. The sign stood next to a series of concrete half circles, nested within each other. She stood up on one of the outermost rings and surveyed the structure. Did it make a pattern? The circles weren't perfect circles, more like curves and lines that converged and diverged in a seemingly random ways, only taking some kind of predictable shape in the way that they ebbed and flowed against each other. As if the resistance between them was what had formed them.

She hopped down from the outer ring and started pacing those in-between spaces. She followed different paths back and forth, sometimes changing direction, sometimes only taking the outer paths, sometimes only the inner ones.

A rustle and a cracking of branches broke her out of her meditive maze. Without thought her body bolted down to the ground, whatever languid grace had built up in her body flattened out by fear. More crunching and crackign in the distance. Was it getting closer? She scooted through the sand and dirt, scraping the shelled particulate of the concrete benches as she went.

She peered out from the edge of the outer ring of benches. She took deep breaths and steadied her heart. Silent breaths, someone had taught her. Some nameless gone person who had helped her survived. All that was left was the way to still yourself to protect yourself. Her body remembered even if her mind did not want to linger on any particular faces.

The surge of forest was a handful of yards away from her. Not too far to surveil them, but far enough that she couldn't see anything crouched or hidden there if she had wanted to. So she reeled her head back in and rolled on her side, closing her eyes, just hoping to avoid being spotted by whatever menacing thing was there.

Minutes passed. Her body still held the tension it had trained so hard at keeping. She heard more rustling, but farther away now. Birds exploded in the sky, then disappeared.

She would have to risk moving at some point. She could slink back down to the ravine to safe confines of Building 300. But everything had gone still again. This, like so many other things, would have to be faced.

She rolled onto her stomach and lifted herself up slow, slowly to standing. She started walking but with a slight hunch, reserving power in her body to launch itself in fight or flight. Her hands twitched, as if grasping for the hilt or handle of a weapon. But she wasn't exactly a weapons type of person, had made it this far without brandishing anything in fear or anger.

Once in the trees, she scanned side to side, looking for whatever menacing thing had made a sound. A squirrel jumping from limb to limb made her jump. Then her heart stopped racing. Nothing else moved and whatever had made the sounds had cleared out.

She sat down with her back to a tree and tried to clear her mind, to focus on the things in front of her. Bursts of fear like this could break down the dams of her self-control at any moment. She had seen people start laughing hysterically after confronting some horrific scene. Her composure was a prized possession and she intended to keep it.

The loudest thing now was the crinkle of the trash bag as she pulled it from her vest and fluffed it up. She paced back and forth grabbing handfuls of leaves to stuff the bag. Once it was full, she flopped it onto her shoulder and made her way carefully back to the stairs. She tied off the bag tightly and dropped it down ahead of her, then made her way back down to the water level.

Back at the building, she wrenched open the door again and entered the still, silent enclosure of the building. The thick concrete walls comforted her. They muffled the sounds outside, even made the waves seem less aggravated and intense. Inside the building, she could feel safe.

She sprinkled the leaves from the bag on the ground, crouched down to assemble them into a pile. She tore apart the trash bag too to provide more cover and keep in more heat. She hoped these arrangements would keep the building feeling like a viable shelter for a while longer.

# Chapter 2: 10-11-12-13 #

Don't stay too long outside. Avoid exposure. Keep low. Don't let them hear you. Find somewhere safe.

These bits of phrasing were the survivals mantras she repeated to herself almost daily. They were pieces of wisdom and experience picked up as she adjusted to surviving in the world as it was now. This world that seemed harsh and forbidding, so reluctant to sustain life anymore. A world even more at odds with the people living it who pushed and clawed against its mute, persistent refusal to sustain them.

Most nights she was too tired to dream, too exhausted from being to let even the most terrifying nightmares wake her up. When the nightmare did break through, she would find herself awake, her own hand muffling her shrieks. When she woke up this way, she had to find an outlet for the twisting gloom that overcame her. So she walked the shoreline over and over.

Her track was numbered for her and she kept pace between the markers: 10-11-12-13. She counted her steps, her breaths, her swinging arms, between each marker. The markers were high up on posts, white background, red circles around large black numbers. They faced out to the water. Clearly they had meant to communicate something to people on the water, not on the land. But there was no one on the water now to communicate with.

So they formed the place markers of the shoreline place she lived. They marked out the measured steps that separated her from her ease and her fear.

Some days, she would pay a visit to particular markers. When the sun was warm and peering through the clouds, she would sit on the piled rocks that the waves crashed against by marker 10. Marker 12 stood by the staircase that was her connection to the world above. Marker 11 stood near the remains of one of the metal walls that peered up out of the water like an ancient animal's rusted spine. Marker 13 stood near a small bridge and a short curved wall. On the other side of the wall was a stony beach.

She rarely went past Marker 13, had an almost superstitious fear of what was beyond it. Her world and her days since she found Building 300 were marked by those markers and numbered by those numbers.

Since she started living there, she hadn't given much thought to what was past the marker and past the stone beach. There only seemed to be the remains of the path led into winding ravine that was filled with downed trees and debris. A dark tangle of things that the world felled and destroyed. Had she been the type to be swept away by metphor, everything past marker 13 would have lingered in her with the markers that meaning leave on things.

Instead she was content to trace her path, to carve out the spaces in her days with those very specific places in those very specific ways. But this day she walked to marker 13 and used the remnants of the curved wall as a balance beam and paced back and forth with her arms out. She bobbed back and forth. Her undernourished body didn't have the grace that one better fed and less overwhelmed by stress might have been.

She started to grow tired of pacing. Her distraction started to give way to wandering thoughts, which usually was a sign she needed to change something about her scenery or her actions. She had to move and keep moving to keep her distraction up, keep it spinning like a millstone to wear away at the grist of thought and memory.

She started pacing and hopping at intervals, hopping up onto the wall then hopping down. Again and again, up and down.

When tired of her pacing and hopping, she jumped down into the bramble on the other side of wall and walked to the sliver of rock beach. She sat down on the smooth, worn stones. They were warm. Her body curved to their shape, even though one by one the rocks were hard and unforgiving. But mashed into whatever mathematically improbably pattern they were in, they seemed soft and yielding.

She felt her body lean back on to the stones. It wanted to give in to the tired feeling that came over her. It wanted to drift in dark behind her closed eyes, so full of nothing and sameness.

She folder her hands behind her head. Her eyes dropped in and out of sleep. It was almost surprising how drowsy she felt, how ready her body was to give in to sleep out here in the open. She could give in to the temptation right now. Giving in would negate everything bad and threatening out there. IT would mean that the world hadn't been torn asunder and everything up ended afer all. Her sleep could do that right here and right now.

Her eyes started to seal shut when a loud screech of tires in the distance jolted her awake. The crumpling sound of metal followed the screech. Then silence. She sat up, her heart racing. She shifted into a crouch and listened. She could her silence in the distance. Then maybe a faint cry of help.

She couldn't tell for sure; human voices seemed so alien now. But human voices didn't sound like the bits of nature she surrounded herself with now. So the sound registered as something unique. It came from the direction of Marker 13, past marker 13, into the bramble that she didn't venture into.

She walked to the point where she couldn't walk easily, where the ravine climbed up on each side and trees rose up against the sky. She could hear the voice calling for help still. She felt the urge to investigate, maybe to help. She started making her way through the debris and growth to get there.

As she made her through the ravine, she saw large concrete pillars up ahead that used to support a road that traversed the ravine. Most of the road had crumbled away.

The voice calling for help was clearer and closer now. The path cleared out and she stood at the base of the roadway. On her left remnants of an art piece climbed up the side of concrete pier. The art seemed to crawl with primordial insects, primitive leaves, and the undulating root systems of trees and waterways.

While the lefthand side tried to immerse her in the earth's vast timeline, a timeline that dwarfed any human experience,  to the right was a different scene. Overhead, the back half of a car dangled from the edge of the roadway, the undercarriage caught in a few twisted pieces of rebar that stuck out from the broken concrete.

She stared at, not knowing what to do. Part of her was struck by the sight of a car. Much like those crustaceous monopods on the mural, the car seemed like some primordial relic. But here one was, clearly driven by someone who seemed to be injured now.

But what could she do about it? Just beyond the bridge and the car, a broken down staircase climbed up topside. It was a smaller version of the one closer to her building that she had scaled a few times already. Maybe she could go up and and help that way.

Once she was up there, what would she do? Who was in that car? Maybe it was a trap. She had heard of elaborate schemes to draw people out into dangerous situations. How could she tell?

As she paused there, not sure what to do. The metal rebar began to whine and bend. The car slipped forward more. She would have to act now to help at all. She started to angle to the far opposite side of the path to keep clear of the car. She stopped to see if she could see who was trapped up above, but couldn't see anyone.

Squared up with the car as she was now, and now directly underneath the bridge, she realized just how high up it was. The car door started to open. So there was someone inside. But the door wouldn't budge, only only creaked open a few inches. The person inside must have been shoving and struggling with it with all of their strength. But with each shoved, the car rocked more and more.

Just as she started to move from her frozen state, the person must have given one final shove, but the force was too much for the precious position the care was in. The extra force tipped the car and it slid back over the road's edge.

She watched as the car feel in front of her. It flipped back over and landed with a sickening crunch on its roof. Chunks of glass flew out in all directions.

The car bobbed front to back as the energy built up from the fall dissipated. Then it was still. There were no more sounds. No cries came from the car. The car sat there, still, like a bug flipped on its back and crushed by some unknowing force.

Rather than run towards it, her body propelled her away from the scene. She crashed back down the path towards the water and towards Building 300. She ran past Marker 13, past Marker 12, past Marker 11. And there was Building 300, sitting between 11 and 10. There it sat slightly pivoted on the shorefront to greet her, solid and sure, uncrumpled and fixed there to the ground.

A feeling of relief came over her as she shoved the door closed and huddled on the floor. She didn't cry but sat there clutching her arms wrapped around her legs. She used her silence to keep the image of the crunched damaged car at bay. Used her silence to erase the sounds that someone else's voice had made in a moment of fear and desperation, as if the silence would erase those things that had conditioned the human voice to speak terror and fear.
