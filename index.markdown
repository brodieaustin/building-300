# Chapter 1: The Building #

No road or path led her to Building 300. There were no roads and no paths then, just the broken, faded outlines of them. Just her feet tromping through the brush, the weedy grasses and plants like brushes that only painted brown. Even now, huddled in Building 300 she could hear the crunch and pad of her steps, so many steps that took her from here to there.

It wasn't worth remembering what here had been. There was no here there anymore. No one had here to recall. She certainly didn't. Here wasn't something to wrap herself up in to keep warm now that night was stalking day with its dark and cold. There was here now. And here was Building 300.

The waves outside the building never lapped, only roared. They roared from far away; they roared from up close. The roar was always the same. A long inhale and a ferocious exhale as water swept up over sand, rocks, metal, and debris. She could hear the waves now, getting closer, seemingly pulling the land down into its depths. Soon, the water would  swallow up her footpaths. The close ones to the water that made foraging for food a little easier.

She shivered as the newly cold air crept in through the buildings large metallic grate. She was too tired to do much about it. But tomorrow, that would be her project. So she crouched in the far corner of the low rectangular building and pressed her body close to the concrete walls that still emanated whatever heat those thick walls had absorbed from whatever pittance of sunshine was left outside.

The next morning, she woke with a chill damp feeling all over her, yet her body strangely burning and hot. Everything was odd contrasts now. Restlessness that wouldn't give way to fatigue; fever spells that left her freezing. The world emptied of everything and yet full of threat.

She stood and stretched and tried to follow some semblance of an exercise regime. The regime was just broken phrasing of poses and positions she mechanically enacted, as if re-running a buffer of routines. She rummaged through her tattered box of rations--really just broken bits of food collected along the way. Most of the crackers and bars and snacks were stale, but a few dry, tasteless crumbs was enough to push hunger back.

The only working door squealed as she shouldered it open, the door's bottom scraping and catching on at the bottom with each shove. Once she stepped out onto the loose sandy outside, she shouldered the door back.

There was nothing of real value in the building, but the building itself. So she didn't secure the building in any meaningful way. Tucked at the base of a ravine and long the shoreline, the building wasn't there to be noticed.

She walked to the side of the building with the large metal grate and examined it. The side angled inwards, which gave the small building an angular trapezoidal appearance. The grate was taller than her and surrounded by broken pipes and conduit.

She ran her hands along the angled vents of the grates. She peered through one at eye level, spying on the intimate emptiness inside the building. It pleased her that there was hardly any evidence of anyone living there. That seemed right.

Standing there, she considered her options. She could pack the vents with mud to create insulation. But when the weather warmed up would the building be stifling inside. She had only found the building within the last days...weeks...months. She wasn't very sure, but the weather had already been breezy and cooling by the time she found it and took shelter there.

The only thing to do would do insulate from the inside. She scanned the ridgeline of the ravine above the building. Thinning trees and dying brush darted and raced along the edge of the drop to the water's edge. She would go up there to collect the leaves and branches she would need to build her shelter within a shelter.

She picked her way along the broken remains of a path, most the pieces had been washed with lake mud and brushed with sand. This probably had been a leisure path at some time. Families would come here with their strollers. She passed a twisted rusty bike frame lodged in mud further down the shore. A relic of a world she could barely remember anymore.

A old black trash bag rustled in the breeze, caught in the bramble of bushes. She fished it out. It was still intact enough to hold whatever materials she needed to transport back to the building. She waded up the bag and shoved it under the puff of her outermost vest.

At some point, an imposing staircase had been built to draw visitors down to the water's edge. The staircase once had stood confidently on the face of the ravine, twisting and turning into a series of landings. Now the structure clung to the ravine face, tilting and swaying as it stood there.

She had passed this way many times. She liked to look at the faded remnants of a mural that had been painted on the concrete base that supported the stairs. Root systems and branches and leaves sprawled out luxuriously against undulating fields of orange and blue.

Her fingers grazed the length of the painted mural before she started her climb up the stairs. The structure groaned as she put her weight on it. She had found during a the only other time she climbed it that using the outside structure was safer. That other time a step had given way under her weight. The thick beams that made up the structure was less likely to rot away.

By the time she reached the top of the staircase, she could feel the sweat from her skin working hard to cool her down, even as her layers of clothing fought to keep in what little heat they could.

At the top of the stairs, a broken piece of signage caught her eye off to the right. What remained of the tree cover was thicker there so she headed that way. As she picked her way through the brush, she couldn't help but feel very exposed up above. The cloud cover was thick and heavy, as it usually was. Even under the thick grey shield, she felt a now instinctive need to find cover.

But she wanted to see what the sign was and what it pointed out. The sign stood next to a series of concrete half circles, nested within each other. She stood up on one of the outermost rings and surveyed the structure. Did it make a pattern? The circles weren't perfect circles, more like curves and lines that converged and diverged in a seemingly random ways, only taking some kind of predictable shape in the way that they ebbed and flowed against each other. As if the resistance between them was what had formed them.

She hopped down from the outer ring and started pacing those in-between spaces. She followed different paths back and forth, sometimes changing direction, sometimes only taking the outer paths, sometimes only the inner ones.

A rustle and a cracking of branches broke her out of her mediative maze. Without thought her body bolted down to the ground, whatever languid grace had built up in her body flattened out by fear. More crunching and cracking in the distance. Was it getting closer? She scooted through the sand and dirt, scraping the shelled particulate of the concrete benches as she went.

She peered out from the edge of the outer ring of benches. She took deep breaths and steadied her heart. Silent breaths, someone had taught her. Some nameless gone person who had helped her survived. All that was left was the way to still yourself to protect yourself. Her body remembered even if her mind did not want to linger on any particular faces.

The surge of forest was a handful of yards away from her. Not too far to surveil them, but far enough that she couldn't see anything crouched or hidden there if she had wanted to. So she reeled her head back in and rolled on her side, closing her eyes, just hoping to avoid being spotted by whatever menacing thing was there.

Minutes passed. Her body still held the tension it had trained so hard at keeping. She heard more rustling, but farther away now. Birds exploded in the sky, then disappeared.

She would have to risk moving at some point. She could slink back down to the ravine to safe confines of Building 300. But everything had gone still again. This, like so many other things, would have to be faced.

She rolled onto her stomach and lifted herself up slow, slowly to standing. She started walking but with a slight hunch, reserving power in her body to launch itself in fight or flight. Her hands twitched, as if grasping for the hilt or handle of a weapon. But she wasn't exactly a weapons type of person, had made it this far without brandishing anything in fear or anger.

Once in the trees, she scanned side to side, looking for whatever menacing thing had made a sound. A squirrel jumping from limb to limb made her jump. Then her heart stopped racing. Nothing else moved and whatever had made the sounds had cleared out.

She sat down with her back to a tree and tried to clear her mind, to focus on the things in front of her. Bursts of fear like this could break down the dams of her self-control at any moment. She had seen people start laughing hysterically after confronting some horrific scene. Her composure was a prized possession and she intended to keep it.

The loudest thing now was the crinkle of the trash bag as she pulled it from her vest and fluffed it up. She paced back and forth grabbing handfuls of leaves to stuff the bag. Once it was full, she flopped it onto her shoulder and made her way carefully back to the stairs. She tied off the bag tightly and dropped it down ahead of her, then made her way back down to the water level.

Back at the building, she wrenched open the door again and entered the still, silent enclosure of the building. The thick concrete walls comforted her. They muffled the sounds outside, even made the waves seem less aggravated and intense. Inside the building, she could feel safe.

She sprinkled the leaves from the bag on the ground, crouched down to assemble them into a pile. She tore apart the trash bag too to provide more cover and keep in more heat. She hoped these arrangements would keep the building feeling like a viable shelter for a while longer.

# Chapter 2: 10-11-12-13 #

Don't stay too long outside. Avoid exposure. Keep low. Don't let them hear you. Find somewhere safe.

These bits of phrasing were the survivals mantras she repeated to herself almost daily. They were pieces of wisdom and experience picked up as she adjusted to surviving in the world as it was now. This world that seemed harsh and forbidding, so reluctant to sustain life anymore. A world even more at odds with the people living it who pushed and clawed against its mute, persistent refusal to sustain them.

Most nights she was too tired to dream, too exhausted from being to let even the most terrifying nightmares wake her up. When the nightmare did break through, she would find herself awake, her own hand muffling her shrieks. When she woke up this way, she had to find an outlet for the twisting gloom that overcame her. So she walked the shoreline over and over.

Her track was numbered for her and she kept pace between the markers: 10-11-12-13. She counted her steps, her breaths, her swinging arms, between each marker. The markers were high up on posts, white background, red circles around large black numbers. They faced out to the water. Clearly they had meant to communicate something to people on the water, not on the land. But there was no one on the water now to communicate with.

So they formed the place markers of the shoreline place she lived. They marked out the measured steps that separated her from her ease and her fear. The markers were the countdown to and from Building 300, and measured how far she was willing to leave behind a place that seemed like home and how long it would take to return.

There were so many other strange remnants left behind on the shoreline. Pipes and culverts and signs. So many communications that the other time, those other times. So much of what remained must have been there to move water from here to there, to drain away things that were not supposed to be there, to divert floods and debris to places where they could lay fallow and remain.

So much engineering had gone into making this place, this one little patch of shoreline into a place people would want to visit. She marveled at the effort. It was almost impossible to imagine that people had once shouldered into such difficult feats now. All she could do these days was trace her paths, mark her markers.

She barely worked at keeping hunger away. She had managed to live with a gnawing knot in her stomach for so long. She had scraps of food, bits of memories of when food was pretty and packaged. She managed to forage for in the woods too, collecting berries, mushroom, and whatever leafy herb-like things she could scrounge.

This wasn't forest feasting by any means. She was now connected to primordial history of gathering, of subsistence living. Hers was the human body that had evolved to survive hunger, to survive, against all odds. Her mind wasn't one to contemplate this evolutionary urge to be, to inhabit, no matter what.

Here she was. Whatever she was now. That things was here, living in Building 300, marking days into the paces between 10-11-12-13.

Some days, she would pay a visit to particular markers. When the sun was warm and peering through the clouds, she would sit on the piled rocks that the waves crashed against by marker 10. Marker 12 stood by the staircase that was her connection to the world above. Marker 11 stood near the remains of one of the metal walls that peered up out of the water like an ancient animal's rusted spine. Marker 13 stood near a small bridge and a short curved wall. On the other side of the wall was a stony beach.

She rarely went past Marker 13, had an almost superstitious fear of what was beyond it. Her world and her days since she found Building 300 were marked by those markers and numbered by those numbers.

But she did like to throw stones in the water. She would hop over the curved wall near marker 13 and crouch close to the lapping line of water. One after another, her hand one grope for a round, smoothed out stone, and lob it into the water.

She didn't throw them far, didn't try to skip the flat ones. There was no need to impress anyone, since no one was here. With each tossed rock, though, she took great satisfaction in the deep, resonant sound the stone made, a rich thump. And of course the ripples

Her eyes would trace out the concentric lines from the ripples, follow them until they ebbed out into the flat surface of the water, or were wiped away by more waves.

Today, like many days before, she was lobbing rocks when something bright and bobbing in the water caught her eye. It was further up the shore than she was used to going, further away from Marker 13, but she couldn't stop watching it.

She looked around cautiously, as if concerned that some onlooker might observe her unusual behavior. Of course there was only the shake of the grasses and trees and pound of the waves around her.

So she ventured further up the beach. Doing so required her to hop along large chunks of concrete that seemingly that been deposited there many years ago. At the edges of these large chunks, twisted, rusted pieces of rebar flayed out. She almost caught her foot in a web of rebar on one piece, but manage to regain her footing before she did.

The bright thing turned out to be something orange as she got closer. When it was finally fully visible to her, she realized that it was a life vest that had gotten tangled in a bent piece of a metal barrier that broke waves that crashed over it.

For some reason, she desperately wanted to retrieve the vest, even though it was just out of reach. There was a small enough chunk of concrete nearby that she thought she could nudge close enough to make a bridge or platform to reach it. She pushed and pulled at the chunk of concrete, finally sitting down and pushing at it that way.

She inched across the concrete slab on her knees and reach out to grab the vest. Water sloshed up on the slab, getting her knees wet, but she wasn't drenched. With one final stretch, she was able to unhook the life vest from the twist of metal that had caught it.

The vest was surprisingly new looking, but she realized the fabric was ripped on the lower left side. She turned it to look more closely, realizing that in fact there was a hole torn through it, an almost perfect finger sized hole. She turned her forefinger through it and then looked inside the vest.

Her finger poked through the hole into a smear of a dark red stain that radiated from the hole and ran down. She dropped the vest and backed away form it. The waves caught the vest, trying to reclaim for the water what had been meant for the water originally.

She sped back along the beach and quickly as she could, staying in a low animal crouch, darting like a nervous rodent from slab to slab. Her ankles turned violently as she recklessly stepped through the stone beach.

She turned back again and again, hoping the vest would be out of sight. But there it was. The water was refusing to erase it from sight. But kept pulling it in and pushing it back into view. She wanted it to disappear and regretted that she had been so entranced by it before. She could still feel the vests's threads and foam core around her finger.

She walked along the dirt path back to the low wall, pulling at her finger, as if trying to rub off the haunting sensation of that hole and the vest, and the smear of blood that stained the inside. She was so caught up in this self-cleansing that she almost didn't hear a low rumble in the distance, echoing over the expanse of water.

She turned to face the water and could hear the sound more clearly. The sound was a steady, mechanical chug. Definitely not natural. Probably an engine of some kind, however improbably that might be. She hopped over the the low wall, crouching there for defense and protection.

She squinted into the day's dull light, trying to look as deep into the water's expanse, as if trying to peel apart the horizon line to reveal what was hidden there. Her eyes weren't too good and couldn't see so clearly. She did have a broken pair of glasses in her vest pocket. There was only half of a cracked lense in the right eye.

Luckily, that was her dominant eye. She slipped on the glasses and could make out what was in the distance a bit better. There on the horizon line she could just make out the long, low outline of a boat, probably some kind of barge, seemlingly large. Very far away and not heading in her direction. It seemed intent on heading northwards, but where was it going? Where had it come from?

This far away, growling boat wouldn't say. She did creep back onto the beach to see northwards more clearly. With the broken glasses on, she followed the shoreline as far as she could. The only thing she could make out, far in the distance, were the tops of three smokestacks that sat atop a building that even this far away seemed to by huge and hulking.

At this distance, the building was nothing more than an abstraction of faint grey shapes. But it loomed. And in its looming seemed ominous, ominous because it beckoned, demanded to be seen on the shoreline.

# Chapter 3: Arc of Nature #

Since she started living there, she hadn't given much thought to what was past Marker 13. Now there seemed to be any number of ominous possibilities. She didn't venture that far to Marker 13 much now, as she tried to resist the pull of the factory or power plant or whatever the building was that stood there in the distance.

She did hear engines from time to time. But with no rhyme of reason, with no particular pattern. Sometimes the sounds were there just for a moment and then gone. And then weeks passed and she didn't hear anything.

Her curiosity got the better of her, so she ventured back in the direction of Marker 13. Besides the wall and the stone beach, there only seemed to be the remains of the path led into winding ravine that was filled with downed trees and debris. A dark tangle of things that the world felled and destroyed. Had she been the type to be swept away by metaphor, everything past marker 13 would have lingered in her with the markers that meaning leave on things.

She climbed over the wall and observed teh building again. It just sat there and seemed much more inconsequential now. Just a shape that was there, worth very little consideration at all.

She finally decided to turn back and return to her shoreline pacings, but decided to use the remnants of the curved wall as a balance beam and paced back and forth with her arms out. She bobbed back and forth. Her undernourished body didn't have the grace that one better fed and less overwhelmed by stress might have been.

She started to grow tired of pacing. Her distraction started to give way to wandering thoughts, which usually was a sign she needed to change something about her scenery or her actions. She had to move and keep moving to keep her distraction up, keep it spinning like a millstone to wear away at the grist of thought and memory.

She started pacing and hopping at intervals, hopping up onto the wall then hopping down. Again and again, up and down.

When tired of her pacing and hopping, she jumped down into the bramble on the other side of wall and walked to the sliver of rock beach. She sat down on the smooth, worn stones. They were warm. Her body curved to their shape, even though one by one the rocks were hard and unforgiving. But mashed into whatever mathematically improbably pattern they were in, they seemed soft and yielding.

She felt her body lean back on to the stones. It wanted to give in to the tired feeling that came over her. It wanted to drift in dark behind her closed eyes, so full of nothing and sameness.

She folder her hands behind her head. Her eyes dropped in and out of sleep. It was almost surprising how drowsy she felt, how ready her body was to give in to sleep out here in the open. She could give in to the temptation right now. Giving in would negate everything bad and threatening out there. IT would mean that the world hadn't been torn asunder and everything up ended afer all. Her sleep could do that right here and right now.

Her eyes started to seal shut when a loud screech of tires in the distance jolted her awake. The crumpling sound of metal followed the screech. Then silence. She sat up, her heart racing. She shifted into a crouch and listened. She could her silence in the distance. Then maybe a faint cry of help.

She couldn't tell for sure; human voices seemed so alien now. But human voices didn't sound like the bits of nature she surrounded herself with now. So the sound registered as something unique. It came from the direction of Marker 13, past marker 13, into the bramble that she didn't venture into.

She walked to the point where she couldn't walk easily, where the ravine climbed up on each side and trees rose up against the sky. She could hear the voice calling for help still. She felt the urge to investigate, maybe to help. She started making her way through the debris and growth to get there.

As she made her through the ravine, she saw large concrete pillars up ahead that used to support a road that traversed the ravine. Most of the road had crumbled away.

The voice calling for help was clearer and closer now. The path cleared out and she stood at the base of the roadway. On her left remnants of an art piece climbed up the side of concrete pier. The art seemed to crawl with primordial insects, primitive leaves, and the undulating root systems of trees and waterways.

While the lefthand side tried to immerse her in the earth's vast timeline, a timeline that dwarfed any human experience,  to the right was a different scene. Overhead, the back half of a car dangled from the edge of the roadway, the undercarriage caught in a few twisted pieces of rebar that stuck out from the broken concrete.

She stared at, not knowing what to do. Part of her was struck by the sight of a car. Much like those crustaceous monopods on the mural, the car seemed like some primordial relic. But here one was, clearly driven by someone who seemed to be injured now.

But what could she do about it? Just beyond the bridge and the car, a broken down staircase climbed up topside. It was a smaller version of the one closer to her building that she had scaled a few times already. Maybe she could go up and and help that way.

Once she was up there, what would she do? Who was in that car? Maybe it was a trap. She had heard of elaborate schemes to draw people out into dangerous situations. How could she tell?

As she paused there, not sure what to do. The metal rebar began to whine and bend. The car slipped forward more. She would have to act now to help at all. She started to angle to the far opposite side of the path to keep clear of the car. She stopped to see if she could see who was trapped up above, but couldn't see anyone.

Squared up with the car as she was now, and now directly underneath the bridge, she realized just how high up it was. The car door started to open. So there was someone inside. But the door wouldn't budge, only only creaked open a few inches. The person inside must have been shoving and struggling with it with all of their strength. But with each shoved, the car rocked more and more.

Just as she started to move from her frozen state, the person must have given one final shove, but the force was too much for the precious position the care was in. The extra force tipped the car and it slid back over the road's edge.

She watched as the car feel in front of her. It flipped back over and landed with a sickening crunch on its roof. Chunks of glass flew out in all directions.

The car bobbed front to back as the energy built up from the fall dissipated. Then it was still. There were no more sounds. No cries came from the car. The car sat there, still, like a bug flipped on its back and crushed by some unknowing force.

Rather than run towards it, her body propelled her away from the scene. She crashed back down the path towards the water and towards Building 300. She ran past Marker 13, past Marker 12, past Marker 11. And there was Building 300, sitting between 11 and 10. There it sat slightly pivoted on the shorefront to greet her, solid and sure, uncrumpled and fixed there to the ground.

A feeling of relief came over her as she shoved the door closed and huddled on the floor. She didn't cry but sat there clutching her arms wrapped around her legs. She used her silence to keep the image of the crunched damaged car at bay. Used her silence to erase the sounds that someone else's voice had made in a moment of fear and desperation, as if the silence would erase those things that had conditioned the human voice to speak terror and fear.

# Chapter 4: Ice #

Snow had been dusting the ground for weeks now, off and on. Never accumulating, just creating mottled patterns of white, grey, and brown. The air was cold and wind was picking up. Her clothing options were limited, in her panicked moments of fleeing chaos and destruction she hadn't had an opportunity to think critically about what she would need once winter came.

A couple of layers of shirts, a sweatshirt, and a light jacket was all she had now to insulate herself from the increasingly intense cold. And until a few days ago, the cold had been somewhat invigorating. She was enjoying her morning walks and the biting feeling of the cold against her cheeks.

Sometimes, her fingers would drain to white and look like shriveled husks of what fingers were supposed to resemble. She would have to huff and puff on them to warm them up. And her right big toe had a habit of getting cold too, but she was still wearing simple, unstructured canvas shoes. These were minor inconveniences to the simple pleasure, the surprising delight that she was able to find in the cold.

But in the last day or two, the cold was becoming more intense, more bitter. There was a heavy, swollen purple tint to the clouds. A previous version of her from a previous life would have checked the weather report, and confirmed that the wind and wet in the air meant snow. Serious snow.

As the air got colder, she found that she couldn't spend as much time outside, and had to huddle more and more inside the building. Whereas before she would have taken comfort in being sheltered inside, she noticed that now it started to wear on her. She was feeling irritable and impatient. Confinement felt more like imprisonment than convalescence.

Maybe it was time for her half-life in Building 300 to start to resemble something more like a homestead. Maybe she needed to form something that looked more like a life, at least in whatever form lives could take in the world as it was now.

This meant that she would need supplies, more supplies and better supplies. This would mean venturing further away from the building than she had before. She had a vague memory from days she wandered her way towards the building that there had been a housing development a bit to the south.

At the time, each door and window in those once perfectly symmetrical domestic boxes seemed like openings to any number of potential terrors. So she had stumbled her way as quickly as she could past them, trying to be furtive and cautious in her panicked state.

She didn't venture out much at night, but now that night was arriving so much earlier, nights seemed to outweigh days suddenly. Venturing through houses in the day could be risky. She didn't want anyone seeing her breaking and entering and cornering her in one. Much better to slip in and out and avoid being seen altogether.

So that evening she prepared to find the houses again and collect proper winter gear to get her through these cold days and weeks to come. She emptied the small backpack that had once been a school girls that she picked up from a temporary shelter. The girl and her family were nowhere to be found. So she evacuated the childish things that had been packed inside and shoved her few extra pieces of clothing and a bit of food and set off.

In the dim light of the building, the backpack still glimmered and glowed with glow-in-the-dark gems and a printed filigree that must have resembled an enchanted gate that had unlocked some princesses' fate in a story she wasn't familiar with.

Before she set out, she took a small pen knife and pried off the glowing gems. She used the knife's edge to scratch away that glowing filigree. All that was left were the worn, rubbed out paths that had once delighted a child on the first day of school. She ate a few bites of an old granola bar to fend off hunger and set off down the beach.

She usually didn't go much further south than marker 10, but tonight she did. The trail disappeared, leaving her to scramble over rocks to pick her way along. Doing this in the dark didn't seem like a particularly good idea to her. The water seemed like an impenetrable wall in the dark.

The rocks gave way to sliver of a sand beach, much of which had been eroded away, but there was enough there to walk along. The sand was wet, but still gave each step a pleasant, springy cushioned feel. The shoreline was flattening out now, she wouldn't have to scramble up now.

Up ahead she could see mound of rocks that caused the water's waves the crash and foam. A small horseshoe like inlet and been created by two rough piers of rocks. They were weedy and in disarray now.

But the trees had been cleared in this area. Off to the right just up a slight incline was a street and the fronts of those houses she had seen so many weeks or months ago. A small service road led to a small concrete building, less bunker like than her Building 300, but equally utilitarian and seemingly deserted.

She scrambled along the road to the building and ducked behind it. After her flutter of movement, she couldn't detect anything in the housing stirring. But she waited for a long time to be sure. She listened carefully for any voices, any sounds that humans make even when their being still and silent. But she didn't hear anything and didn't see anything. There was no evidence that anyone was laying in wait for her, ready to spring a trap. These were just empty, deserted buildings.

She adjusted her backpack and readied herself to sprint to the nearest house. She sprinted across the weedy, rough field, bound over the cracked pavement of the street, up the driveway, and onto the house's front porch. She crouched down by the front door. She reached up to try the lock, but the door was open.

The door creaked a bit as she pushed through it. Inside, she found herself standing in a typically open floor plan house. A staircase in front of her leading to a second story, a family room with furniture in disarray, a broken dining room table. Clothes and belongings were strewn about everywhere. It was a common a scene now as the once well kept yard and budget furniture store furniture had once been.

She inspected the kitchen first, figuring that would give her a good idea of how well provisioned this house might be. What she found didn't give her much hope. The cabinets were all thrown open, several were just barely hanging from their hinges. This house had been picked over well and thoroughly.

Based on these findings, she decided to move on to another house. Looking out the kitchen's back window, she was looking down a stretch of backyards. these houses were all arranged perpendicularly to the house she stood in. She didn't want to move inland too far from the shoreline. Staying close to the shore and the water, gave her some comfort. She considered the beach to be her path for escape if anything bad happened.

She stepped through the broken glass of the back sliding door and down the small wooden deck. She inspected the houses to each side, looking for a house that didn't have a broken back door. It look three houses before she found one that looked promising.

The only problem now was actually getting inside. The back door was locked and she couldn't find any loose windows. She crept around the to front and same problem. Locked up tight.

She went around to the back. Under the elevated wooden deck were large, smooth stones. Maybe she could use one to break the backdoor's glass. She crawled underneath the deck until she found a stone that seemed sufficiently hefty.

She looked around furtively again, a slight feeling of guilt overcame her as she hoisted the rock over her head. But just as soon as the feeling came, it left as she flung the rock at the door. The glass shattered with a loud pop, but there was an opening now for her to get through.

This kitchen was much more promising. She opened a few cabinets and found a few cans, crackers, and meal mixes. Nothing was expired, no cans were bulging or mishapen. She almost wished she had a bigger backpack to bring more items. She rummaged around underneath the sink and found a shopping back. She didn't want to load herself down too much, but took enough to get her through a month or two with little worry about going hungry.

Now it was time to look for clothing, blankets, anything to help keep her warm. She moved up the basic stairs lined with basic carpet that even in the dark seemed to have a slightly plastic shine it.

At the top of the stairs three bedrooms and a bathroom arranged themselves around the landing. She picked the door straight ahead and found herself in the remains of a master suite. The large king sized mattress had slid off the box spring. Sheets and clothes were in a tangle on the floor. Two doors in this room led to a large closet and a bathroom.

She stepped into the bathroom. Her hand instinctively reached to flip the light switch next to the metal and class medicine cabinet. The switch clicked up and down several times, as if moving by itself, doing nothing. She realized what she was doing and looked around her, only to find herself looking in the mirror.

A skylight overhead let in some light from the night sky. Her face floated in the mirror, ghostly and incomplete. She could hardly bear to look at it eye to eye, so her eyes just traced her reflection's edges. She hardly recognized the person looking back at her. Hard eyes, gaunt cheeks. Hair greasy and plastered in so many directions under the smokey gray beanie she wore.

Behind her, a large deep tub invited her into its curved depths. She stepped away from her reflection and into the tub. The plastic thumped loudly as she got into the tub. She lay back against the gentle sloped side and rested her arm on the contoured cutouts on each side.

The tub still smelled slightly of tub cleaner and shampoo. Wax from a burned out candle was stuck in one corner. She rested there for a moment, taking in the silence of the house. Not quite transported to some scene of domestic bliss and comfort, but peering at the boundaries of this other world that still existing here in this suburban house's master suite.

The reverie passed as a chill passed over her. She climbed out of the tub and examined the medicine cabinet and cabinets under the sinks. What little medicine and supplies were there, she tipped into her bag. She examined the closet, but it was much too dark to tell what was inside of it. So, she started pulling out what remained. Shoes boxes, a small dresser of underwear and socks. Shirts, pants, a few sweaters. Several heavy blankets.

With everything piled up, she picked through everything. She pulled out a heavier pair of shoes, socks that weren't threadbare and full of holes. She rolled up the blankets so she could sling them around her.

Still no coats to be found here, so she headed back downstairs to the coat closet by the front door. The only coat left hanging there was long blue wool coat. It had a military look to it. It was a few sizes too big and hung down nearly to her ankles. But it fit well enough to not fall off of her completely. And its thick layers would keep her warm.

She was ready to leave, but before she did, she lingered in the family room for a while longer. She shoved aside a pile of old mail and magazines and sat on the sofa that had once been lined up properly with the walls and fireplace that formed the room's focal point. Not the sofa was pushed at an odd angle and didn't frame anything in the space.

She sat there, just breathing, just pausing, much as she had in the bathroom upstairs. She rifled through the pile she had just moved and pulled out a cooking magazine from the pile. Leaning back into the sofa, we flipped through the glossy pages full of deserts and platters or luxuriously roasted meats.

Strangely the food didn't make her salivate or hunger for it. The dishes, arranged with flowers and fine linens and flatware, seemed like something from another world. It was hard to grasp that people had once eaten like this, that food had once looked like this.

The food on those pages, seemed more like a piece of art. She felt no more moved to eat it than she would have a few brush strokes of paint on a canvas. There was a visual richness that drew her attention and made her look, but her body didn't respond to it with the repertoire of simple responses it was now used to using.

The attraction broke and she tossed the magazine back on the pile. It slide unceremoniously to the floor and rested there with other junk that had had been left behind. It was time to head back, to leave this shell of a shelter and return to Building 300 where she would sleep a bit warmer than before.

She crept back through the backyards of the houses, a little less quickly and quietly as before. She was feeling a bit more relaxed now and her new hear slowed her down and made more sound as she went along. She still sprinted though from the first house she entered across the street and the empty field.

She made it back to the blue roofed building and paused there, catching her breath.  As she stood there, she scanned the shoreline, the beach with the two piers of stone pilings. The beach looked different to her now. The sand seemed more tossed up and disturbed, but she couldn't be quite sure.

She proceeded slowly and cautiously down the short road that led from the building to the beach. The sand did in fact look different, but maybe she hadn't noticed how much she had disturbed things when she passed through there earlier.

But as she stopped and looked more closely, she realized that she couldn't have made the beach look as different as it did. In fact, the beach looked different because there were footprints criss-crossing over it that weren't her's.

# Chapter 5: Prism #

There were footprints on the beach that weren't hers and they were heading in the direction of Building 300, her Building 300. But she noticed that the footsteps didn't march in that direction directly. The footprints seemed to be spread out in a fairly random way, as if someone had been stumbling about on the sand before heading to towards her shelter.

The footsteps she followed continued to be irregular. These weren't the confident strides of a healthy person. The top of the building was just in her view when she saw someone, a man, slumped against a tall striped column, shaped like an obselisk that had been installed on the shorefront at some point. Green, blue, and tan stripes ran up and down the length of the obelisk. It was a strange object to have standing solitary on the shore the way it was.

Maybe it was the subtle natural shades of the stripes, or the fact that the obelisk's purpose was so obscure, but she had not really thought much about their presence since her first week or so living in Building 300. At the time, she had wondered before if it had been some kind of measuring device, perhaps part of the same warning system as the numbered markers. Maybe boats had used the markers and obelisks to determine if the tides were working properly.

Now, though, the stripes and marks took measure of the man who was slumped against the obelisk. She approached him cautiously. He didn't stir or otherwise acknowledge her presence. He was soaking wet from head to foot. Apparently, he had reached the beach from the water. She hadn't seen or heard any boats since she started living in the building. Mysteries seem to layer themselves upon this figure.

When she was within a few steps of the man, he seemed about to awake, but slumped off to the left instead. She instinctively rushed forward to help him up. He was heavy, much larger than she was. Older too. She realized now that his face was wrinkled, bearded, and gaunt. Much like her, he had layers of clothes on, topped by a double breasted rain coat. His hair had grown long and was plastered to his face.

She tried to shake him awake, but he wouldn't open his eyes. She could tell that he was still breathing, still alive, just passed out. He was starting to shiver though. She realized too just how cold it was. Her hands, now damp from his clothes, were starting to freeze and feel brittle.

She knew she had to get him inside, but needed to unburden herself of her supplies first. She wrenched open the door and put her bag and blankets inside. She also threw off her overcoat, not wanting it to become soaked through. She dashed back to the man and crouched down next to him.

She threw his limp arm over her shoulders and strained to lift him up. But the strain was too much. The best she could do was drag him to the building. It wasn't far and he wouldn't be any worse for wear. So she pushed him back down to the ground, this time he fell to his right side. She grabbed both of his wrists and started to drag him.

It took several fits and starts to get him inside the building. Once inside, she placed him on the opposite side of where she normally slept. Even in the midst of helping this man, she knew she was taking a risk bringing him into her space. So she would leave some distance between them.

Once she had him positioned, she took a towel that she had hanging up to dry. It was harder than usual from the cold, but she was able to work it to the point that she could dry his face and hair. She tried to pat down his clothes as best as she could to dry him off.

She considered making a fire to keep him warm, but decided that it would be too risky to draw attention to herself now, particularly since she had no idea where the man came from or if anyone was out looking to find him. So, she draped the towel over him and heaped up the leaves and branches she had used for her bedding over him.

Back in her corner, she unrolled her blanket and huddled underneath it. She had a packet of airline pretzels in her pocket that was half eaten. She unrolled the split opening and started eating each salty, twisty pretzel fragment very deliberately. The pretzels gone, she drank a few sips of water from a crumpled up water bottle. She tried to stay awake as long as she could. But after an hour or so of sitting there, watching the man, he had not moved at all. She nodded off and fell asleep.

She woke up to the man's muttering and crying out in his sleep. "Damn you, no. Not ever. Hands off. You won't... You won't..." He was thrashing about, but seemed to settle back down. She crawled over quietly to check on him. He was on his side. He had almost knocked all of the leaves off of him. She took one of the blankets she still had from the house and threw it over him.

She looked up through a small grate above the door and could tell that day was beginning to break outside. The heavy darkness was giving way to light. Since it was still somewhat dark and she was already up, she decided to go outside and monitor the situation outside.

In the morning's dusky dark, she scurried over to the large rocks near the building and crouched behind them. She surveyed the horizon, where the water and sky met in the distance in both directions. She still didn't see any boats. She couldn't hear anything in the distance that would indicate that danger was nearby, setting aside for the moment the question of whether or not danger had already been invited inside the building.

For now, she shoved down that concern and let the need to provide help take over. She knew that she would need to build a fire to warm the man up and dry him off better. So, she headed back into the building. She had a small collection of firewood that she had been collecting and keeping inside to keep it dry. She mounded up some of the leaves that surrounded the man and made a little wooden structure around with twigs. She used a half empty clear green plastic cigarette lighter to light the whole thing up.

The wood was smokey but the building's vents drew enough out to keep her eyes from burning too badly. As the fire started to take hold and flicker, the building's wall pulsed with red and orange tones. As the fire grew and she fed more wood into it, the hard linear lines inside the building, and the remnants of pumps and machines, softened with shadows. The interior space began to resemble a cave, some primordial space where ancient peoples took refuge.

Later in the day, the man begin to stir. He groaned as he started to sit up, but fell back down on his back. She went over to help him up, but in his stupefied daze he started waving her hand away, grumbling, "Get away...get."

He dug his fingers into his closed eyes, rubbing them hard, as if trying to rub them out. With this eyes covered, he finally said in a more coherent voice, "Where am I?"

When she didn't answer, he opened his eyes and said, "Hmm, not the boat. What is this place?" Then he noticed her, "Who are you?" She still didn't answer, only sat there looking at him. "Don't say much, do you? Not much to say these days, I guess. Help me up, huh..."

She grabbed both of his hands and helped him, the leaves rustling around him as she did. He was on his feet but wobbling. "This place smells terrible. What is it?" He look around more, seemed to be noticing the old pumps and machinery, "Some kind of pump house. Where are we? Aww, why am I asking you? You're not going to tell me are you?"

She looked back him, just staying silent, watching as he seemed to come back online, to regain is awareness, his consciousness. She went to the door and shouldered it open. Cold air howled in through the doorway. It was snowing again outside.

The man stumbled over to the door and peered out. The light seemed to be too much for me. He recoiled from it at first and then leaned the upper half of his body out of the door. "A beach. That's the lake. I'm still pretty wet. Did you fish me out of the water?" She shook her head and pointed back down the beach in the direction they came. "Must have washed up on shore. Well, no use going into that now, I guess." He closed the door. "This is a real 'look what the cat dragged in' kind of situation isn't it. But maybe we've both been dragged in here, depending on how you look at it."

The man sat down by the fire, held his hands out to warm them. He would warm them, rub them briskly, and warm them some more. "How long have you been living here?" She shrugged. "I guess this is as a good a place as any to hunker down. Got any food? I'm starving..."

She pointed over to box of food she had resupplied. "Slim pickins'. Nothing fancy here," he said. "But it beats what I've been living on."

She could hear a few wrappers being ripped open and crunching and chewing. There was so much more noise now in the building with another person. She had not quite realized just how quiet her existence here had been until now.

After he finished eating, he limped over to the pile of branches and started to lean over, looking over his shoulder, he asked, "Mind if I?" She shook her head no. He grabbed a few and tossed them onto the fire. It went smokey again and the wood hissed as it released whatever water was left in it. But the smoke started to dissipate and the fire burned a bit hotter.

The man sat back down in his spot. "If it's all the same to you, I'm feeling pretty beat. Gonna close my eyes for just a bit. No need to be nursing over me the whole time. I'm sure you've got whatever it is you do here to do."

His joints creaked and popped as he sat back down. It didn't take long for him to fall back asleep.

# Chapter 6: The Boat #

Snow was falling steadily, in an almost mathematically predictable swirl. The flakes were large and puffy, as if someone had been hurling slivers of white confetti from the sky. It was filling in gaps and cracks wherever it found them, giving everything around the building a smoothed out, contoured look to it. The snow was even starting to accumulate along the metal barriers that jutted out into the water, making them look less like bony ridges and more like puffy appendages, like cold-damaged fingers.

Throughout the day, several inches of snow had fallen, enough to make trudging through it challenging. So, the winter storm kept her inside, kept her from following many of the little routines that she usually followed, the observances that have given her life here structure, pattern.  

So did having a house guest in Building 300. The man would sleep for an hour or so, be up for a few more, and then fall back asleep. He didn't say much when he was awake, mostly just stoked the fire with a bent piece of steel rebar and stared at the flames.

Now that he was here, and seemingly in her care, she wasn't entirely sure what to do with him. She could feel his yearning for conversation, but that wasn't a need she could satisfy. She kept to her quiet, much as she had done for so long now. Besides, what would she say? Her brain could barely shape any meaningful stories, didn't want to turn everything that had happened into rehearsed chapters and paragraph breaks.

And what stories would there be to tell that hadn't already been told before? He was here and worn and tired. He knew. What good would shifting platitudes back and forth between them do? So, there was no mad rush of words to fill the space between them, and the snow was making everything so much more muffled and quiet than it already was.

The fire gave a loud crack and he looked up at her. They made eye contact. She could see pain washing in behind his tired eyes. Whereas she had seemed worn and folksy, she realized now that he was exhausted, spent. "You're probably wondering what my story is, aren't you?" She nodded.

"Well, I'm not much of a storyteller, I guess. Course, neither are you." He let a little private chuckle escape with the quip. "My story isn't really a story, so I won't go back to the beginning or anything like that. So it's a pretty simple story, I guess. I'm looking for my grandson. We got separated, back in the city."

He paused and stared into the fire, breaking his eye contact with her. "That's not entirely true. He left me. We had an argument. He's a teenager. Somethings never change, used to argue with his father all the time when he was that age too. Always told myself that I'd do better... Well any way, we had an argument and he left me behind. Now I'm looking for him."

She looked in the direction of the water, wondering how his watery appearance on her beachy doorstep happened. "Oh, the water. Pretty dramatic, I guess. I was on a boat. There's still a few running out there. Well now they're all ferrying people north. For a price..."

The only thing she could think of that was north was the hulking factory or power plant. "The rumor is that some group is getting the power plant up north fired up again. Gonna get it running and get us back to civilization, whatever that means."

He shifted a bit, leaning back against the wall. He closed his eyes and pitched his head back against the concrete. "Oh what I wouldn't give for an aspirin right now. Getting old isn't kind and being old and getting pitched off a boat is even worse. Yeah, that's what happened. I had scavenged enough to get passage onboard one of those ferries. Pretty miserable actually. Thing moved slower than you can imagine and pitched every which way in the waves. Waves are terrible these days. The lake ain't what it used to be, not that it was some little pond before."

"I started to get sick, really gut wrenching sick and threw up on a guard. Real touch looking guy, real beat up looking and ugly. Not like me of course.... So this real scary looking guy is covered in vomit and we get into a tussle. So he just pitched me overboard. Heard even worse happens to people that step out of line, beatings, shootings. You name it. At least I just hit the waves like a rock and was able to wash up on land. And then you found me."

"Now, I don't know what to do. I guess I keep looking. I have no idea how far that place is. Hell, I don't even know if my grandson made it. I'm hoping he did. But who knows. But I can't think of much else than this headache right now."

She got up suddenly, "Where are you going?" She went over to her backpack and rummaged through it. She tossed something in his direction. He wasn't quick enough, so the plastic bottle thumped against his chest and landed in his lap. He picked up the bottle, turned it around, and smiled. "Aspirin. Let's see if this helps."

He swallowed a couple of pills dry, and waved away the crumpled plastic bottle of water she tired to pass to him. "If I'm feeling better in the morning, I'll be heading out to continue my search if it's all the same to you. You know..." he leaned towards her, "You could come with me, up north."

She didn't respond positively to this suggestion. "Look, I understand that you'e holed up here. You think you've got a good thing going. But it's getting cold out there. And it's just going to keep getting colder. Once everything is frozen up, it'll easily feel 10 degrees colder here on the water. How are you going to survive that? We don't have to stick together after that. But we're probably better off together than alone. Well, just think about it. I'm going to try to get some rest and wake up without this pain in my head."

She stayed awake until the fire started to give out and stamped it out. She curled up under her layers of blankets, puffing hot breaths into her hands to keep them warm. She thought fleetingly about the man's suggestion, to travel with him north. To go with him to a place where people were gathering.

What good would come of that, she wondered. People being together hadn't worked out so well before. The sanest thing, and safest, seemed to be what she was doing, finding some small place in the land to burrow in and be forgotten, forget.

She started to close her eyes. As she did, her wind wandered to images of the car, it falling, the crunching sound it made. The way it wobbled back and forth, back and forth, creaking. She wanted to push the images away, but she couldn't displace them with something else. Finally, she fell asleep. She would decide in the morning what to do.

# Chapter 7: Mastery Reason #

She jumped at the gentle shove on her back, a hand rocking her back and forth. "Hey, I'm sorry to wake you up, but I didn't want to leave without saying something." She turned her head back and looked up. The old man was crouched down. He had all of his clothes on, his dry clothes. His hair was damp and slicked back from his face. His skin seemed loose and ashy in the dull morning light.

She nodded, sat up, then got up. She went over to her small stockpile of food, medicine, and other items. She gathered together a few supplies for the man, wrapped them up in a small towel, and turned to hand the bundle to him. "Oh, I shouldn't. You don't have much here." But she repeated the gesture  several times, and he finally relented.

"I guess that settles the matter of you coming with or not. I understand. If I can, I try to come back for you. Who knows, maybe I can send my grandson to fetch you and tell you all about living up north. Maybe that will convince you."

He left Building 300 and pushed the door closed behind him. Even though she knew she would be fine, wanted to be fine her in this life she had made for herself, she felt an urge to help the old man, to not let him venture out on his own. She had already helped him this far. There didn't seem to be any reason not to trust him or his story. What was keeping her there?

Routine, habit. Other things were keeping her rooted to that spot as well, but she was less willingly to think about those things. This was familiar. This was the now. Finally she knew what the now would bring. And knew that now's now would be much like tomorrow's now, even though that now was becoming increasingly less predictable.

She stood in the building of those four thick concrete walls, feeling more alone than she had felt in some time. This other force in her, the force that was telling her to join the old man, to go north, to venture out and grasp at what might be better than what she had now, led her to start packing her things up.

Most everything fit in her backpack, another sack, or stuffed into her coat pockets. She tied up her bedding crosswise over her shoulder and found herself standing on the shore, turning towards Marker 11. She turned to give the building one last look. Maybe her last? She didn't know. But the building sat there with its thick slanted concrete walls, as if hunkered down for the uncertainty that was sure to come.

She set off at a brisk pace. It didn't take her long to catch up with the man. He had only made it to Marker 13. He was sitting on the low wall, seemingly catching her breath. He shielded the sun from his eyes with a flat hand and looked in her way. "I didn't make it very far. Guess I'm not as recovered as I thought. Maybe you can sit with me for a few before we continue on."

She sat down next to him on the stone wall. "It's very peaceful here," he said after they had sat in silence for quite some time. "I can see why you were reluctant to leave. And it makes me want to stop you from coming with me, even though I know I need your help." He turned to her, a very serious look in his eyes, "I don't know what we'll find up north. I can't promise anything. I've heard the stories. The same stories that everyone else heard. Many people heard those stories and set off at once. Other weren't so sure. But how can you hear about a promised land and not feel a hankering to set off after it?"

He was quiet again, pausing either for effect or to let his words really make an impact on her. "You're sure you want to do this?" She hopped up and off the wall. She looped her left thumb through her backpack straps and reached out with her right hand towards him, offering her hand to him. "Okay then, which way?"

She pointed behind him to the beach, but he seemed to reject that idea. "No, we need to stay off the beaches. We can't risk being spotted by those boats. Believe me, we want to stay out of the way of them as long as we can."

That meant venturing past Marker 13, past the site where the car crashed. It was difficult to go that way, but the man seemed determined to staff off the beach. She she went first picking her way through the overgrown path. She tried to break branches and trample down foliage as much as she could as she went to clear a path for the man through tangle in the ravine.

They moved slowly, but each step brought them nearer and nearer to the car. She felt like they were careening towards it. Yet each step seemed to be diving the line between her and the car into ever smaller segments, again and again, making the chance of ever reaching the car seem impossible, as if it would be impossible to actually find it and see it again.

But soon enough there it was. She shoved her way out of the brush and into the clearing at the base of the broken down bridge. Nothing about the scene had changed. There was the car, the broken glass. Above the twist of rebar and the gaping hole in the roadway.

The man let out out a long whistle as he stepped into the area around the car. "That's a sight." He walked closer to the car, trying to peer into it, to learn something of the mystery of how a wrecked car had ended up here.

He look up at the bridge, "Driver must not have realized that the bridge had given out. Wonder how long it's been here." She looked at him, shrugged. And with that they passed it by.

She didn't know why she had shrugged. She wasn't likely to volunteer any information. She couldn't have pretended to not see the car, not to acknowledge it. There it was. There it would continue to be. Maybe long after she was no longer alive. That car would sit, sit and rust, until nature finally lay claim to the responsibility to deal with the car and the driver and the incident at the bridge.

"We better find a way out of this ravine soon," the man yelled up to her. "We're heading too far west, we need to start veering north." She had not really been this far before, and didn't know how much farther they would have to go until they found a way up that both she and the old man could traverse.

The path wasn't as difficult as it was closer to the water. She started to look around and feel the the crips air on her face, watch her breathe huddled into small streams of vapor and then disperse into the air. She didn't mind having to walk a little further along it, perhaps even secretly hoped that somehow, against all of the laws of nature and physics that the path would somehow bend back upon itself and carry them back to the starting point again, though maybe with fewer of the unpleasant things along the way.

Rather than bend back on itself like a forested mobius strip, the path started to bend north now. Just up ahead, something like a small trestle bridge spanned the ravine. As they got closer, she realized that the bridge or struts or supports were holding up a large pipe. Maybe another relic of the all of the engineering to move water around that she had noticed back by the lake. Water leaked from some of the rusted joints in the pipe, leaving pools of liquid on the remnants of concrete below.

Vines were growing up the trestles, but one of them, the one planted on the right of the path had words on it, made up of large metal letters that had been affixed to railings that traversed the structure. She couldn't make much sense of how or why the words were put together the way they were. "Mastery... Reason... Control... Explore," were just a few of the words that caught her eye.

What seemed to have been an art piece fo somehow, now seemed like cryptic instructions left from one civilization to another. Only now the hidden logic, the understand that would have bound those words together was broken. She could read them and understand them, but they didn't mobilize any particular feelings for her.

Here was another structure that was part of this place where she had found refuge. Only now, rather than as a thing to contemplate and take comfort in, these instructions, these stark exhortations, were something to pass by, to leave behind, as they tried to find a place to get enough of a foot hold to climb up and out of the ravine.

"This seems like as good a place as any to get up and back into what's up above," the man said as she started to lead him past the cryptic word art. "Besides, I"m getting tired again and think I need to rest." She looked more closely and realized that the area around the trestles would be easier to climb up and they could use the trestles to steady themselves.

# Chapter 8: The Tower #

Getting up topside wasn't too difficult, though she had to steady the man a few times. When they stepped up on the pavement of a road above, he hunched over and caught his breath before they moved on.

Just up ahead and down the road were houses on each side, and then what looked to be a fenced off area. Further area, looming over the trees and the houses, she could just make out the top of a tower. She could see the lines of the roof and the gentle curves of windows that must be set along the tower's perimeter.

The man nudged her, "We should head to that way. Maybe we can take a look and see from the tower and get a better idea of where we're going." He started to walk down the road towards the fenced in area.

She was frozen in place, reluctant to move. It was difficult to shake the fear and uncertainty of being out in the open, exposed like this. She had managed to only venture up when she needed to for so long, that not being burrowed in to the dips and recesses of the ravines and waterfront felt uncomfortable to her now. Even having someone with her didn't ease the anxious feeling she felt. It may have made it worse, had she stopped and really worked to unpack these feeling.

She wasn't able to properly asses and diagnose these criss-crossing feelings working at cross purposes to one another. She had survived thus far, had managed to keep herself alive and out of the way of everything that causing havoc and destruction around her. And yet, she was paralyzed by fear, partly because the effort to keep the horror and terror at bay left little energy for much else.

The man walked back to her and held out his hand. She waved it away, took a deep breath and started walking, passing him at first. He picked up his pace, "I don't plan on asking you why you don't talk. I don't need to know. I've seen enough to understand completely. But you aren't alone, at least for right now. We can help each other out. We just need to..."

She felt this had the makings of a very nice speech, probably unnecessary, but nice. The speech was interrupted suddenly by an explosion of dogs barking and throwing themselves up against the metal fence. The fence rattled and rocked, looked very close to toppling over.

They both startled and stopped. A few more dogs joined the pack. The new ones fresh to the excitement barking the jumping, the other in the forefront whimpering and pacing. They both started to walk more quickly, but the dogs continued to follow them, continued to raise a ruckus as they did.

She wished that the dogs had not been so loud. It really would have been fine if they just hadn't drawn so much attention to the two of them, but here they were, isolated in the middle of a street with one entrance and one exit, and feral dogs calling the worlds attention to them.

At the end of that stretch of street, the fence on the left side, the side with the dog pack, was sagging. The post on the corner had been knocked loose at some point. Whether before or after was hard to know. Ahead of them, they started to see buildings built in rows, uniformly a tan yellow color with brown roofs.

"Look like barracks," the man said in a halting, panting way. "We need to keep going." The dog pack had consolidated at that weak corner, the dogs were piling on each other. One dog managed to reach the top of the pack and rolled over the sagging top of the fence, at first with a whelp.

Confused by what had happened at first, the dog realized that it was free from the gate, notice her and the man just a a little ways ahead and set after them. She turned back before it was too late, and grabbed the man and started to run. Neither of them had the full stamina and speed of fully healthy person, but both of them ran faster than they probably thought they could, propelled by fear and adrenaline.

They turned down another block and started running that way. The turn threw the dogs off momentarily, but not long enough. They veered left again. She looked up at saw that they were running towards a tower that all of the streets seemed to lead towards.

The dog hadn't tired of chasing them yet, but the man was getting winded. She pointed out the tower to him and he nodded in agreement, "Just...keep...running..." he said. But she didn't plan to leave him behind.

As the tower drew closer to them, she noticed something unusual, or at least thought that she did. Up at the very top of the tower in one of the row of arched windows, she thought she saw a flashing light. But maybe it was just a trick of the light outside that her think she saw a light where there were only dark, empty window.

A few more steps. She saw it again. Then again. In fact, the light was flashing in some kind of pattern, maybe a meaningful one, maybe not, but certainly a deliberate and intentional one. In either case, she clearly has seen someone up there signaling to them.

"I see it too," the man said. "Just a little further."

The road did, in fact, terminate around the tower. The structure itself was surrounded by a circular road. The tower was built on arches, which allowed a road, the one they were on now, to run through the middle of it.

She wasn't sure exactly where to go, or how this light signaler intended to help them. Then up ahead she saw something being lowered down, a ladder. The singular was lowering a ladder for them.

She was the first to reach it and started climbing up the old wooden ladder hand over hand, foot after foot. The old man was behind her. Unfortunately, so was the dog. It was managed to catch up with them and lunged at the man. His left foot was well within the dog's reach and it tried to clamp down on lower leg. It wasn't quick enough to latch on completely, but did manage to bite the man. He cried out in pain. She looked down behind her, but kept moving up the ladder.

When she reached the top of the ladder, she tumbled out into a dark, brick-lined room. She offered her had to help the man up. He rolled onto the floor, cursing as he rolled on his back, "Damn dogs. Never liked dogs much. This settles it."

She scanned the dim room to see if she could spot who had helped them with the signal and the ladder. But the room was empty. All she noticed was an old wooden door, slightly ajar, that seemed to lead to a staircase. The man noticed the staircase too, "I think I can make it up if you help."

They moved slowly up the narrow staircase, passing a small window that seemed to be punched into the thick brick walls. Then must have gone up 5 stories, before they took a break on the landing, then continued on up the stairs.

Finally, at the top of the stairs, they found another door much like the one below, only this one wasn't ajar. She reach out to open the door and the handle spun around in a circle a few times. She rotated it back and forth but with the same results.

Then she heard a voice call out, "Just shove it. Give it a shove. With your shoulder." So that's what she did. The door gave way just as the voice had suggested it would, and they stepped out into the large, crowded upper floor of the tower.

Large pipes ran up and down the brick walls. Spindly light fixtures that terminated into a smooth, sloped shape hung evenly every few feet. Overhead, thick steel beams that ran across the ceiling. But more than any of these architectural features, she realized that the room was full of thing, a riot of clutter in every direction.

At first glance, she couldn't make much sense of what was in the room. There were stacks of dishes in one place. Broken bits of electronics with their wires hanging out in every direction. Books, books piled and unpiled as far at the eye could see.

And in the middle of all of this chaotic jumble was a nervous looking man, probably not much older than she was. He wore several sweaters layered on each other, but each one full of rips and holes. He pants were frayed and both knees worn out. He wore an old woolen army cap, the kind with fancy folds and pleats.

"Good, you saw my signal. Someone finally saw the signal. You were smart to notice it. I'm glad you did," he started in, pacing as he spoke. "At last the signal worked. Did you understand it? What it meant?"

She looked at the old man, and simply nodded to the nervous-looking man. The old man winced as the pressure on his injured foot started to wear on him, "She's not a talkative one. So don't take it personally if she doesn't respond. But yeah, we saw the signal."

The younger man didn't seem to register what the older man had just said and continued on, "I knew it was only a matter of time. Just waiting. Had to be patient. So glad I waited. So glad."

"Well, we're glad too, mind if we sit. I'm not holding up too well here."

"Yes, yes, of course. Just find somewhere..." the younger man peered around the room. "Anywhere really."

She led the old man over to an old chair in the corner next to pile of browning newspapers. She lowered him down and moved a large suitcase over to prop his foot up on it.

"Any chance you have any medical supplies?" the older man asked.

"Medicine, medical supplies. No, didn't fit in my plan. So, no."

"I could use something here, anything. Some antiseptic, maybe a clean bandage. Can we improvise?"

"Improvise? No need, we can scavenge. Scavenging is much better than improvising."

"Okay, makes sense. I'm in no shape to scavenge, so what do we do? Can you go?"

"Me? Oh no. I'm in no shape to leave now, not after all of the work I've done. It would be too hard."

"Well, she doesn't know where to scavenge. Do you think she could take you with her?"

"Her?" He looked her over. "That might work. She's good at keeping secrets. And the things I know are secrets. Must be protected."

The old man looked at her and waved her closer to him. She bent down to hear what he wanted to say, "You don't mind going? You don't have to if you have a bad feeling about it."

She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled in the most reassuring way she could manage. She turned to the nervous man who was looking out of the one the tall slender windows. "We can leave in thirty minutes, but not before. I'll start a countdown." He took out an old antique looking pocketwatch; she couldn't tell if it was actually working from where she stood. He fiddled with it for a moment and resumed looking out the window. "Once the sentinels pass, we'll be all clear. Just thirty minutes."

There wasn't much for to do until then, so we gave the old man some pain relievers and water, just to keep him comfortable until they came back. She regretted not having more useful first aid supplies. Her impulsive decision to follow the man on his journey to find his grandson seemed even more impulsive now.

Even after thirty minutes the of being in the nervous man's space, she couldn't really make heads of tales of what had been accumulated in the room. She also wasn't entirely sure if he had gathered all of this stuff. He seemed to be completely uninterested in it, and much more preoccupied with what was happening outside. He did, periodically, and very quickly, move towards a table against one of the walls and look through the contents of the desk.

He signaled that it was time to leave by heading to the stairs and starting to walk down the ten flights to the first floor. She assumed that the sentinels has passed, but wasn't exactly sure what that meant or how he knew. She wondered where exactly he would take her. She also hoped that there weren't any more dogs roaming free outside.

When they got down to the bottom floor, he opened the hatch through which she had entered previously and peered down through it. "I think the dog left. That's a good thing. Or it could be a bad thing. It depends. But I don't see it. So that's good...for now." She agreed with him that this was a good thing and also couldn't hear any distinct dog sounds.

They climbed down the stairs and set off in the opposite direction they came from to get here. The nervous man moved very quickly in bursts of movements, punctuated by periods of prowling and lurking. He very clearly had made journeys like this before and knew how not to be detected.

After two blocks, he veered off to the right. After several streets of similar two and three story buildings, they entered into a square with a large building in the middle.

Before entering the clearing, he paused and crouched down. She did the same. He waved her up closer to him, "This used to be an army base, a long time ago. Many secrets here. They kept the hospital running. Why? No one knows. That's where we're going."

The area around the hospital seemed to be clear. The man darted out suddenly into the open, keeping his hands over his head as he ran. She wasn't sure what the immediate danger was, so she just ran as fast as she could to keep up with him.

They circled around to the back of the hospital building. Concrete steps with a rusty hand railing led down to a metal door without a visible handle and a sliver of a window. The glass had metal mesh embedded it. From the look of it, the glass seemed to be intact. Somehow the man was able to push at the corner of it and get his hand inside. He reached a little further in until the door began to swing open. He carefully pushed the glass back into place and went inside.

# Chapter 9: The Hospital #

She wasn't sure exactly what she was expecting, but the scene inside the hospital surprised her. Everything was in disarray in inside. The ceiling grid was missing tiles, or tiles were sagging from moisture and humidity. A lone chair was overturned off the to side. Brick walls in the basement area where they entered were peeling. There was a general feeling of disrepair, of abandonment everywhere she looked. The building was in such bad shape, that it must have been like this for a very long time.

The man didn't seem to take notice and seemed to know his way around. He led her to the stairwell to head up the first floor. Electrical wires plunged from the ceiling. One section of the wall had been ripped open and sections of pipes had been pulled out. The building had clearly seen its share of scavengers.

They didn't stop at the first floor though. The man led her up the very top of the building. "We have to make stop first. Then we'll get what we're looking for," he said. As they entered the third floor, she saw a long hall of doors with frosted glass. This floor must have housed offices at some point.

She followed him halfway down the hall before he stopped. He turned to her suddenly and grabbed her hands. She started to flinch and pull away, but he tugged her back towards him. "I have to know..." he started.

He took a gulp, then a deep breath, closed his eyes, muttering, "Maybe this isn't a good idea. Maybe this is bad. Really bad." He opened his eyes again, took another puff of air, and seemed to reset himself. "I have to know that I trust you. Can I trust you?"

She wasn't sure how to reply. Could he trust her? She didn't know how to answer the question. She was only concerned right now with helping out the old man, putting one foot in front another, avoiding danger and threats. What role did trust play in any of this?

But clearly this question was important to the man, and affirming his need for trust stood between her and wherever the medical supplied were. Though the thought crossed her mind that perhaps this nervous strange young man couldn't be trusted, but it was too late to worry about that now.

So, she nodded and he replied, "I knew it. I knew it when I spotted you. I've been other people come this way you know. I've been packs of marauders, murders, everything. I've seen them all. And I never gave the signal. I knew the wait to give the signal until I saw you."

He turned towards the door. The doors had windows above them. In this case, she noticed that the window was slightly open, very subtly left in a state between opened and closed. He jumped up and pulled himself through the window. A moment later the door to the office opened. "Come in, quickly..." he said.

The office was unremarkable. A desk covered in paper, drawers half open. A desk chair that titled to the right. A small table by the window with two chair overturned on their sides. Then there were book cases.

Surprisingly the book cases were in good order. Only a few books had been overturned. The man ran his fingers along them and seemed to be counting to himself or rehearsing some kind of repeatable phrase.

His finger stopped on the spine of an old medical book covered in a deep red reinforced cloth. The spine label was too worn the make out clearly. He pulled the book from the shelf, flipped it over several times as if performing a magic trick.

He opened to book from the back. She realized then that the book had been hollowed out in a deep circular shape. He held the book out to her and said, "Take it." She wasn't sure what to take at first so she reached for the book, "No what's inside. Take it."

She looked into the cutout and saw a reflective disc nestled in the cutout, a media disc of some kind, unlabeled. She used her nail to lift the disc from its hollow plastic center. As she held it up, light played across the reflective surface in shades of blues and purples.

"That is your purpose now," he said in a breathless, reverent way. "It's been my purpose for...for as long as I can remember now."

He went over to the window and scanned outside. "You have to protect it, to guard it. You are the guardian now."

She turned the disc over a few more times, expecting to find writing on it or a label. But the disc was blank, shiny and blank. As if responding to her puzzled look, he continued on, "That disc contains very important information. Information," he lowered his voice, "that could save the world. An army officer gave it me as the army left this base. It was sent here a very senior official. Highest echelons of the government, or what was the government. I didn't know how to keep it from falling into the wrong hands, so I kept it here. And the tower. I kept looking for something that would help me read it, to unlock the secret that it contained. But I could never find anything."

He took a long, deep breadth. "Now it's yours. Your mission. I'm so relieved." He held open the book in front of her, and she placed the disc back inside. He handed the book to her. Still puzzled, she slipped it into her backpack. Not really sure what she would do with it now, but feeling the little bit of added weight on her back.

They left the office, leaving the door opened behind them. She moved to close it, but he stopped her, "It doesn't matter now. It's just a room. Nothing in there worth protecting. Now, as for your supplies, there should be a cabinet of supplies on the next floor down. I'll catch up with you, I have just one more thing to do up here."

She went downstairs and saw a desk on the floor, that seemed to have been a nurses station at one point. Behind the desk was, in fact, a small cabinet of supplies. She hadn't been completely sure whether there would be any supplies or not, given how absorbed the man seemed to be in the disc and his mission to protect it.

Inside the cabinet, she found a few wrapped antiseptic pads, packets of ointment and bandages. The supplies were meager, and not particularly new looking, but she hoped it would be enough to stop any infection the old man might get from his encounter with the dog.

With the supplies also stuffed into her backpack, she waited in the stairwell for the man to come down. She waited for several minutes before she began to wonder what happened to him. She held her head down and closed her eyes, as if trying to sharpen her senses. Even with her intense focus and concentration, she couldn't hear anything that would indicate the man was moving.

She put her back to the wall and slid down to the floor, wrapping her arms around her folded up legs. She waited some more until she began to worry about it getting dark outside. Already the early afternoon was dull and dim outside. Less light was pouring in through the stairwell window.

She propped herself back up and headed up the stairs, very slowly, stopping on each stair to listen carefully. With each step and stop, she could feel herself wrestling with a feeling of panic that was welling up inside of her. By the time she reached the next floor's landing, she still didn't hear anything coming from the floor.

Outside of the stairwell, she turned to the left, the opposite direction of the office they had explored earlier and walked the length of that half of the floor. No sign of the man in that direction. She went back the other way, past the office door. Just past the office door, on the opposite side of the hall was an alcove. Slender doors marked with restroom signage were on either side of the alcove.

She poked her head into the women's washroom first and didn't see anything. She opened the door the men's washroom and immediately gasped. The man was still and lifeless, half propped up on the floor, a length of rope gripping his neck. The other end was tied to the bathroom sink hardware.

She didn't rush to help him or investigate. She turned hard on her heel and quickly, intently headed back outside to the tower. If anyone had seen her from afar, they would not have guessed what she had just seen and the flood of thoughts and emotions that she was holding at bay. From a distance, she seemed to be a determined woman walking quickly from point A to point B.

It took several jumps, and finally a running leap, to grab the ladder's dangling end and pull it down. She climbed up quickly, pulled the ladder back up behind her, and head back up to the tower's top level.

The man winced his way towards her when she entered through the door. "I saw you heading back this way. Where's the guy? What happened?"

She walked over determinedly to a table and unpacked the scant medical supplies. She steadied and steeled herself, determined to hold this episode at bay, determined to not let this, this random strange man's death break her down.

The man hobbled over to her, started to put his hand on her shoulder, withdrew it, "Are you okay?" She turned to him with the supplies, a hard look in her eyes. "I see. Something happened and you don't want to talk about it. I get it. I guess I should let you get to work."

She doused his foot with the antiseptic, careless about wasting what could be a very precious supply. She dabbed the foot dry with several gauze packs, applied the ointment, and wrapped it up. The man looked down at the finished product, "Not bad work. My son was a nurse. He would approve." She managed a faint smile and went back to the table to pack up the supplies.

Rather than sit by the man, she roamed the floor and rummaged through the junk in the tower. The man, that dead, lifeless man, had spent countless days and hours harvesting this junk from the buildings around the tower. Had pulled back pieces of conduit, signs, old electronics, motors, clothing, bedding, magazines, pots, pans, tools, and more, piece by piece, bit by bit.

For what? For the disc that she had nestled down in her pack. How could someone had spent so much effort, so much dedication to something that wasn't real, a fiction, a fantasy?

The man had probably spent sleepless nights plotting out each strategy, each step for the next day. And each action was meant to add up to this...this accumulation of fragments, of things ripped from their original scene and compiled in this disorderly plan.

And they had been led into it by a mere faint shiny reflection, some little bauble he had flashed before them, making this riot of his delusion seem like a safe harbor. And with the book shoved in her hand, and some kind of half thought out vow made, she was engrossed in whatever plot he had concocted in this lonely, bleak structure.

The man spoke up and interrupted her reverie, "Nothing to do now but wait. Hopefully I can put some weight on this foot tomorrow. We'll see if the swelling goes down. Looked like a storm was approaching. Maybe snow soon."

She nodded, agreeing that it had felt cold outside; she hadn't really noticed it at the time. She gathered up all of the bedding and blankets she could find in the tower, pulled a few old mattresses into the middle of the floor and made a place for them to hunker down for the night.

# Chapter 10: Passage #

"I found a map," the man said, waking her up from a dimly remembered dream. "Looks like there are some old train tracks to the north. Should get us really close to the power station if we just follow those." She looked around and realized it was still dark out. "If we leave now we can get clear of these buildings in the dark and start out on the tracks as it gets light."

He handed the torn out page from a road atlas to her as she sat up, rubbing sleep out of her eyes. She looked it over and traced her finger over the red lines. Little markers and names came into focus. Sure enough there were the train tracks heading on a sure, straight slant northwards.

The man seemed more surefooted this morning, walking with a slight limp. He walked back to the windows and peered out. "I don't trust these buildings. They seem full of...I don't know...secrets. They seem to want to burst. They just give me a bad feeling."

They started to pack up and get ready to leave. "Not bringing anything along?" he asked. "Could be some useful things in here. Like this. I haven't seen one of these in years." He held out a rounded slab of grey plastic. He pushed a button and the lid flipped open. "Disc player. I used to carry one of these around wherever he went. When I as younger, of course."

He closed the lid and handed the player to her. She turned it over, examined it, but tried to seem uninterested in it. She handed it back. "Not the most useful thing, I admit. But hell, I'm going to hold on to it. Nothing wrong with a little frivolity when the whole world's gone wrong, right?"

She shrugged and started down the steps. Heading down to the ladder was much more a step by step procedure than before. The man wasn't running on adrenaline and seemed much more conscious of himself being an injured person. They finally made it down the ladder. Much the man had done, she peered down through the opening, trying to detect any unwanted animals, people, whatever. After a few minutes listening, she lowered the ladder down and started heading down rung by rung.

As they walked, she kept having to remind herself to slow down. She was leaving the old man further and further behind, without realizing it. She would stop and watch him as he hobbled closer and closer to her. They would pause for a moment, silent, not looking at each other, and continue in their veering course, bearing to the north and west.

Within an hour of walking they had cleared the winding streets of the housing developments around the tower. The crossed a large open stretch of grassy ground before managing their way through a line of trees that seemed to run to the water.

When they broke through the trees, they found themselves standing on the out skirts of a small cemetery. Plain, grey stone headstone were arranged in perfectly concentric circles. In the center of the circle was an obelisk-like monument.

They crossed the field between them and the cemetery. An old split-rail fence bisected the field and traced the path of the road that led into the cemetery. She helped the man step over the rails and on to the road. From the road, they headed into the cemetery, before veering tot he right and picking up a smaller path that radiated from the cemetery's center-most circle.

As she approached the obelisk, she realized that there were two statues on either side of it. One statue was a soldier, dressed in an old-fashioned uniform, faced east. The solider's rifle rested in his hand, tipped against his soldier. His helmet like an inverted bowl on his head; his pants and boots wrapped tightly. The soldier's back was straight; his gaze eastward faraway, either resolute or disengaged, she couldn't tell.

The other statue was an angel, faced west. The angel's head tilted to the side; her gaze was cast down, looking more earthward than heavenward. Her arms at her side, her hands spread out, palms up. Her wings were kept close to her body. She wasn't about to take flight, rather she was stationed here, accepting those ready to rest under her watchful, welcoming eye.

She sat right down on a bench right in the middle of them and leaned back into the obelisk. The man wandered about a little with his limited mobility, studying the grave markers in a seemingly random way. "My father was a history buff," he said. He could have told us about the company and regiments these fellows belonged to. Me? Not so much. Ready to keep to moving?"

She stood back up and the followed the winding road out the cemetery and found themselves in the middle of a three lane road with fading lane markers. Just beyond the road, a line of short electrical poles seemed to be following a path. He pointed ahead, "Look, I think the tracks are just over there. Let's head that way."

They transitioned from the road to a strip of overgrown, weeded ground, and onto the crunch of gravel that surrounded the tracks. Standing on the tracks, she turned her head in either direction and could see clearly for what seemed like an incredible distance. Eventually her sight gave out in a haze of switches and other gear that ran along and over the track. They turned right and northwards and started walking the tracks.

Up ahead, she could just make out a squat, heavy stone train station. There seemed to be something on the tracks, stationary, by the station. As they came closer, she began to hear neighing and chuffing of horses, the ringing of harnesses. "What is that?" the old man said, quietly, more to himself than to her. "Horses?"

The horses were harnessed to a simple, flat wooden platform that had been mounted to train wheels. They didn't see anyone attending the horses, giving the horses and the cart the appearance of having fallen from the sky.

The horses began to sense their approach and grew nervous. They started pacing, seemingly fighting their instinct. The man and the woman both stopped, carefully to not spook the horses any further. As they stood there, a man appeared from one of the train station archways. He was wearing a maroon blazer that was at least one size too small, several dirty shirts underneath, and dark, denim like pants.

[this section needs to be updated to reflect changes to story later on. Needs to be clear that the driver is waiting for someone specific]

He had the look of someone who was supposed to be to dressed up, to convey an that this person was interacting with fine people, someone who had been dressed up by someone else. But the reality, the execution, missed the mark. "You folks have passage?" he asked as he grabbed at the horses harnsess and settled them down.

"Passage..." the old man started to ask, but seemed to feel that there was more at stake in what the man asked. "Yes, of course."

"Deposit the fee at the ticket window. In the drop box," he replied, barely looking at them.

The driver spoke with such detachment and boredom, that she wasn't entirely convinced he was speaking for himself. The words and actions seemed to be automatic. His body moved, but lacked animation. Vitality has drained from him a long time ago.

The old man pressed something into her hand, it was a large silver coin. She turned the coin over and over, tracing the contours of the embossed shapes, the man's profile with a close shaven cut, the eagle spread across the other side with its claws held far apart.

The old man nudged her forward and pointed to the ticket window. She looked back at him, as if to say, "Are you sure?" This coin was probably worth something these days, and he was just casting it off to ride on this cart that went...who knew where it went.

While she deposited the coin, the man walked to the cart, trying to make small talk with the driver, who was now sitting in a simple metal framed chair with fabric that had been bolted somehow to the platform. By the look of the chair, he should have been sitting in a conference room or hotel lobby. But here he was, looking like a rustic ferryman, ready to take passengers across a turbulent fording point in the river.

The old man had already settled himself down on the platform as she returned from paying their fare. She hopped up on the platform too, choosing to sit with her legs dangling off the back. Once she was seated, the horses lurched forward, even though the driver had not looked back at her once.

The old steel wheels scrapped and groaned at first, but soon enough, they were rolling along quite smoothly. "I can only guess the roads aren't in great shape," the man muttered to her. "This seem awful elaborate just to carry people from point a to point b. But maybe there's something else going on." He turned back to himself and didn't talk for a while.

She watched the station get smaller and smaller until the tracks veered at it slipped out of site. From time to time, the road would appear in view again, often below them as they crossed a bridge. In fact, the pieces of road that they saw were is bad shape. Many were blocked with stalled cars, or intentionally stalled cars. Or the roads where turn up with potholes either from weather or people.

The old man scooted around to sit side by side with her. In as covert a way as he could manage, he folded up the piece of map he had shown her earlier into a thin strip of paper. The tracks they rode on now ran at a slant across the strip of paper that they showed her, leaning into her to keep the map hidden.

Wordlessly, his finger traced the track for her. Her eye followed her finder. The tracks went quite far north. Up ahead on the map there seemed to be some kind of large green space by the water. Further past streets reasserted themselves in orderly grids. His finger stopped at the shoreside powerplant from which all of the streets seeemed to radiate.

# Chapter 11: The Hotel #

The cart's bump and rattle started as a annoying distraction, agitating her senses. But the further they traveled on those hobbled roads in the mute heat of the day, she grew more and more tired. Without realizing it, she had fallen asleep. A strong jolt from a particulary deep break in the road jolted her awake. She sat upright, almost in a panic, but saw the man sitting next to her, nodding off as well, and her senses refocused on their surroundings.

The driver kept his back to them, seemingly uninterested in who these travelers might be. She wondered whether he was deeply curious, or, like so many, had learned to focus on the passing moment, not concerned with things that concern couldn't comprehend.  

The man's head jerked forward and woke him up too. He went through the same reorientation process that she just had. They were both used to fits and starts of sleeping in this world they lived in. Sleep wasn't a refuge or escape, just a brief pausing of what continued around you.

He looked ahead and said, to himself or her, she wasn't sure. "Road looks worse than before." He shifted aroudn more, "In fact, I'd say it was torn up on purpoase. Look at it...its almost a pattern." She followed his pointing finger and could see the same. The road seemed to have hatch marks drawn across it by a hasty hand; hasty but effective. "Barely looks like a road anymore," was his final comment.

She wondered if that was the effect. No road meant the end of the line if you didn't know what you were looking for. Someone had gone through a lot of trouble to keep unwanted visitors out. She wondered who that someone or someones might be.

The trees and brush was starting to thin out around them. She started to notice a light dusting of sand here and there along the road. Off in the distance, she could here the sound of waves barrel rolling overthemelves. She tapped the old man's shoulder and pointed at her ears. "Hmm, what's that? Yeah, I hear it too. Back to the shoreline for us."

The old man cupped his hands up to his mouth and shouted ahead, "Hey there...driver. We almost there?"

The driver nodded and pointed ahead to a fork in the road. A wooden sign with white arrows and had been splashed with blue paint making it unreadable. The trees became more numerous, in fact, the land around them almost seemed to be tended. It wasn't the wild overgrown tangle that she was used to seeing nearly everywhere.

She realized that the pavement was smoothing out too as they veered off to the right. There was another, larger sign. This one wasn't painted over. Rather it was painted over, but had been repainted and lettered, meticously to read, "Paz-al-Lago"

They followed this short section of smooth road before the low lying blocky expanse of an old hotel appeared ahead of them. The road they were on split into a parking lot, no cars parked in it, but it was conspicuously free from weeds.

To her eyes, it was all smooth crisp lines, gleaming white, all radiating towards the water just a few hundred fee away. The whole hotel seemed to be made of endless panes of glass, unbroken glass and only one boarded up window to be seen.

The grounds, the glass all communicated to her that this was no derelict refuge. Whoever was here, and whoever was brought here, would find themselves in a kept up building. With, most surprising to her, light. Even in the late afternoon, she would see lights lit up in some of the rooms.

They continued on as the road arced to the left in a semi-circle that made up the entrance to the hotel. Only they didn't stop at the main entrance, they continued along, turning again, passing under an underpass that seemed to lead to the behind the scenes part of the hotel.

They want a little further on across a parking lot then another drive that led a series of smaller buildings. These buildings seemed to have been hastily made, really nothing more that shacks, but they were nestled into the trees. Whether they were located there for shade, protection, or to keep them out of site, she couldn't tell.

It was only here that she saw the first sighting of another actual person. Behind them, were two people washing windows. In the other direction, she could see someone walking the beach, stopped up periodically, as if collecting something from the ground. They also passed a row of bikes that had been chopped up to pedal large carts filled with an assortment of rusty tools.

At the last cabin, the driver stopped and hopped down from his seat. She got down first and helped the old man hop down as well. They grabbed their gear and followed the driver up the steps to the entrance. The driver opened the door and motioned them inside. "You have to stay here for 24 hours. Not allowed to leave. Someone will come get you when it's time," he explained, mumbled more than spoken, and turned back to his carriage.

She stood there with the old man, who seemed as confused as she felt. Were people living here at this hotel? Why was it being kept up in this way if there weren't? Even if there were, she couldn't remember the last time she had set foot on a little piece of orderly land like this. Everything in her field of view was barren, broken, or overgrown.

"Well, guess that's it for the welcome wagon. Sun's going down soon. Might as well take them up on their over of this shelter for the night," the old man said. He stepped ahead of her to clear the three steps up to the shack's door.

The door was set on hinges and whiny spring, like you would find on a sliding glass door. The door was really nothing more than a piece of plywood mounted to a simple two by four frame. It snapped shut back in place as soon as she cleared the doorway and let go of the door.

The cabin had two windows on either side opposite the door. Two mattresses were piled up in the corner. They smelled strongly of some kind of disinfectant. There was no other amenities to speak of, other than an electric heater opposite the mattress and a single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling.

It was dark enough that the man reached up for the beaded metal pull for hte light and clicked it on. The naked metal coils in the bulb light up a hot yellow glow. The light almost hurt her eyes. She couldn't remember the last time she had seen electric light.

"No energy shortage around here," the old man said, adjusting a knob on top of the heater, which started to glow and radiate heat immediately. A strange smell like burning dust filled the space then dissipated once the heater ran for a few minutes.

She nodded in agreement. This cabin, much like the door was nothing more that plywood and two by fours that had been hastily hammered together. Away from the heater, the walls were so thin that it was already starting to feel cold inside. But there was an electric heater and light bulb transforming power into light and heat without a care in the world.

They spent the next hour checking their gear, fishing out a few cans of food. The old man warmed up their food on the heater. Even the lukewarm meal was satisfying to her. They went to rearrange the mattresses and then she noticed the sheets.

She held up a stack of neatly folded sheets on the mattresses. She picked them up and ran her hands over them. The sheets were not soft, but that wasn't what made them notable to her. In fact, it was their starched stiffness that seized her attention. And her fingers. She couldn't help put run her hands over the swaths of stiff startched fabric, marvel at the crisply folded edges.

With the mattresses arranged, they unfurled the marvelous sheets over the mattresses and prepared to sleep. She rolled on her side towards the wall, pretending to fall asleep, but really just lay there staring at the plywood floor's wood grain, tracing out the shapes of faces, of evil creatures sneering in the swirl of lines.

# Ch 12: On the Beach #

The next morning, a chorus of birds woke her up just a light was starting to break into the day. She rose up from the mattress, scattering the smoke from her breath as she did. She grabbed her coat and shoes carefully opened the spring loaded door to peek outside.

As she opened the door, the birds scattered from the trees and around the cabin. Where they had been loud and scittering, she could not hear the water's loud rumble greeting her. No one was around, so she slipped her shoes on and headed down to the beach.

Veering towards the hotel, she pickup a paved path that led from a veranda that stretched across the back of the hotel. She glanced back up at the windows overlooking the water and only saw shut drapes.

The beach surprised her, rather the sand did. Compared to the rocky scrabble of the beach around her building, this sand was almost luxurious. Even in the cold, she footed her shoes off and walked with barefeet, letting the sand curl up around her toes.

She wasn't there to amble along the beach, but she did walk a ways, always keeping the hotel in sight. Somehow her fear of the water and exposure out in the open slipped away in this seemingly normal moment from a life she barely remembered.

That life and that person, the other her. Those weren't things she dwelled on. A grim survivor in a shelter had once given her lecture about clinging to what was, "That ain't coming back. Those tears ain't worth a thing." So now, she just didn't think about those things at all.

But in this moment on the beach, one memory did somehow slip through. It was really more of an instinct than a memory, the body's impulse to economize motion by storing up things it used to do. And this impulse came to the fore when her eye caught a glint of green polished glass in the sand. She bent down, almost without thinking, and picked it up.

She picked at the piece of glass with her finger, turning it back and forth. Her finger traced the bumps of what must of have been a soda bottle. Again, without thinking, she pocketed the glass, her eyes already darting ahead to find more.

She scoured the beach for bits of brown, white, and green glass. She could start to hear them clinking in her pocket now. She was so entranced by the search, that she was startled to see how far she had come. The hotel wasn't in sight anymore, a fact brought to the fore by a snap branches and someone came breaking through the brush along the water's edge.

She looked up towards the sound and crouched down in fear. A man appeared on the edge of the beach. He stopped when he saw there. She studied him momentarily, making the split decision about the threat he posed, a quick decision making process she was hardly conscious of these days.

What she assessed surprised her greatly. The man looked like someone had stepped out of some other world, the old world, the world that had been. He didn't seem to belong to this world at all. His face was ruddy and healthy looking, smooth too, like it had recently been shaved. His hair, though tousled by the cold morning breeze, was cut. A glint of sweat covered his face like he had been exercising.

He seemed well-fed, generous. He wore clean clothes, althetic wear that seemed like it fit him, not like clothes that had been wrested off of a dead body out of necessity. He was smiling at her and walking towards her like it was completely normal to meet someone on the beach and casually say, "Hello," which was what he said, with a hand extended no less.

"Hi, there...Don't run," he said, flattening his hands towards her. "I didn't mean to startle you. I was just out for my morning run." The man inched a few steps closer. She moved back too, but only one step for his two. Her body was screaming at her to run, but she was so captivated by this strange, timeless man, that she couldn't fully commit.

"I always cut through here to finish my run on the beach. See..." He pointed back over his shoulder to  roughshod place in the brush. It did seem like someone had repeatedly trompled through there.

"Are you from the hotel?" he asked. She looked back at the hotel and nodded. "You're new then. I don't recongize you." A breeze kicked up behind her. He seemed aware of the unwashed scent of fear that must have covered her, a smell she didn't register anymore. "Yes, you must be very new. Xavier doesn't usually let the new recruits go about like this," he said, almost an aside to himself.

"What's your name?" he asked. She stared down, not willing to speak that word, even for this person who might as well have been a figment of her imagination. "Really, you can tell me..."

Just then she felt hands grab her from behind, not violent, but protective. She could sense the old man now, standing there, shoring her up. He was panting from the exertion. "Are you okay?" he said breathily. He looked across at the man, "Who are you?"

"Now, friend, that's no way to talk to a stranger. I might as well ask you. After all you're on my beach."

"Your beach?" the old man said.

"Well not mine personally, but this beach is part of the complex. And I am part of it as well. So, let me ask, who are you? And this charming young woman with you?"

"My name is Randall. This is...well I don't know. She doesn't talk much."

"Some kind of injury?" the man asked.

The old man shrugged, "Don't know. I just met her a few days ago and she hasn't said a word to me yet."

"I see," the man replied. He seemed to be elsewhere all of a sudden, following a train of thought. "Well, you must have a busy day ahead of you. I recommend heading back and waiting for Xavier. He always come around for the new people."

"Okay," the old man replied. "We'll do that. Come on," he whispered to her. "Let's get out of here."

They started to walk back down the beach. The man began his jog and passed by them easily. He disappeared up ahead into the interior of the hotel, confirming that at least one person lived there. Two, if you she included this person, Xavier.

As they headed back to the cabin, she noticed that there was more activity around the hotels. People were starting to move around the grounds, sweeping, pruning, wiping down. A few of the curtains were pulled back, the windows glinting in the morning sun.

"We're going to grab our stuff and make a run for it. This place is giving me the creeps," the old man said to her. She silently agreed with him.

They wouldn't have a chance to run though. A man stood in front of their cabin, holding a clipboard, wearing a suit of all things. As they got closer, she noticed how perfectly groomed he was. She even caught the faintest musky hints of cologne in the air.

She imagined that this man looked like a concierge at a hotel must have, someone who worked to smooth over the minor complications that the rich experienced. And in the midst of everything, however unlikely it was, this man stood there, in front of their dilapidated cabin, perfectly comfortable and at ease.

Much like the jogger on the beach, this man seemed absurdly out of place. But he seemed perfectly comfortable with the task at hand, which seemed to be waiting for them and intercepting them. "Leaving your cabin this soon is very irregular, but I have been given special instructions," he said, rounding behind them and practically pushing them toward the motel.

"You're a little...rougher than I was led to believe. No matter, I will oversee your transformation personally."

"Transformation?" the old man asked, his question completely ignored.

The man, Xavier, ushered them through a metal door that led into the hotel's mechanical room. She reeled a bit at the wall of hot, steamy air as they passed by the boilers, then washing machines. The man led them through a maze of passageways until they reached two locker rooms for men and women.

"Go, get cleaned up and changed. Uniforms are in the cabinets. Put your..." he looked them over "...belongings in the in the hamper to be cleaned."

She went in to the women's locker room and found the shower stalls. Grabbing a towel from a stack of them by the showers, she walked to the last of three stalls in the room. The stall was divided into two sections, each one divided by a curtain. She removed her things and piled them up neatly, tightly on the plastic bench. She shivered, not being used to being exposed to the air like she was now.

She slipped quickly in to the shower and turned the levered handle to hot. At first cold water hissed over her, causing her skin to go goosepimply. Slowly, then suddenly, the hot water started to pour out over her, enveloping her luxurious cascading sheets. She looked around for soap and only saw a few ragged fragments, but that would do. She scrubbed and scrubbed at the dirt on her hands, watched as the grime swirled over the tiles and down the drain.

The hot water gave out after a few minutes, leaving her body mostly clean but hungry for another one. She tried to turn the shower back on, but only cold water came out this time. Assuming the water must be metered, she gave up sustain her momentary dream of soapy clean and shut off the water and started to dry off.

With the towel wrapped around her, she walked to the cabinets opposite the lockers that Xavier has mentioned. Sure enough inside were small piles of maroon uniforms. She picked one up and took it back to the bench where she got dressed.

The old man was waiting for her in the hallway, already cleaned up. She wondered if she looked as half-clean and uncomfortable as he did. Either way, he said, "You look like you died and went to heaven." He smiled at her, and given the relaxed, nearly peaceful feeling she felt right now, she smiled back at him.

Xavier reappeared, assessed them and said, "It will do. Come with me."

# Chapter 14: The Sandpiper #

They passed through another door and suddenly were standing in the hotel's lobby. She marveled to be surrounded by such clean, orderly surfaces. Everything from carpet, tiled floors, paint on the walls gleaming in the morning light. She marveled most at the light fixtures--glass cones and spheres suspended from the walls and ceilings. None of theme were broken, even chipped, and they were all, all of them, lit up, even in the full light of the day.

"So you," Xavier said looking at a clipboard, "I believe you are Gerry, you will be on cleaning detail. Go upstairs and join the group that is up there now cleaning pictures and windows."

The old man looked at her tentatively. She gave a half-nod and he followed the path being pointed out to her. "And you are...Sharon, it says here. Let's see. Now that's odd. Your assignment has been crossed out and written over." She didn't know what that meant; she also wasn't sure why she was being called Sharon. In any case, Xavier stood there flipping through his clipboard. He seemed uncharacteristically flustered by whatever change had been made. He muttered under his breadth, "So much for orderly ways of doing things." He took a breathe and looked at her head on and said, "You have been assigned to the Sandpiper. So, right this way."

She followed him down the lobby near the hotel entrance. Across from the entrance, there seemed to be a dining room, the space defined by a series of carved screens. Much like everything else, the dining room was in perfect order. Chairs and tables all lined up and pushed in. Clean plates, crips napkins, and orderly silverware had been placed on each table.

In the far corner, near the windows that looked out over the water, a couple was eating breakfast and drinking coffee. They nodded in recognition at Xavier and went back to their meal. Xavier led her past these people and the dining room to another section that was secluded and out of way, proper walls here instead of carved screens and a door as well. To the right of the door was a sign that read "The Sandpiper Lounge" with a few small round brown birds resting at the margins around the words.

The room was darker here from the wall coverings to the lighting. Recessed lights, lit up much like the lobby lights, throw cones of orange light down in discrete shapes around the room. The tables were smaller here. Along the back wall, a woman, wearing a uniform similar to her own, stood behind a bar.

As they approached, the woman leaned forward on the bar supported by outstretched arms. She raised an eyebrow at Xavier; the woman didn't give her a single look. "Really, Xavier? This is what you're bringing me?" she said in a raspy voice.

"Max, I'm following the plan," he responded, holding the clipboard out to her and tapping it a few times. Her eyes scanned over it. She squinted and drew closer and further away as she did. The woman obviously couldn't see that well. But her eyes did seem to find their way to the crossed out spot in the plan.

The woman took a deep breathe and exhaled, turning back to the bar, "Well that settles that then."

"Yes, it does."

With her back turned, Max gestured with a half-arm wave and said, "Get on back her and let's see your skills." Xavier nodded her towards the woman too.

Taking her cue, she rounded around the bar and found herself staring at a wall of bottles, standing next to Max. Looking over the bottles, she had no idea what most of them were. She did notice that many were partially full. She wondered how long this supply would last and what would happen if it ran out.

"I will leave you two to it," Xavier said, turning on his heel to leave.

The woman waved her arm across the bar and said, "Welcome to the Sandpiper Lounge, where we keep the drinks flowing and the clientele happy." She turned to face her, "You ever mixed a drink before?"

She shook her head "no" in response.

"Huh," Max replied. "Never mixed a drink and yet here we are." She grabbed two bottles off the shelves and sat them in front of her. "Know the differnce between these two?"

Again, she shook her head "no."

"Look, you can cut the cute act with me, just say 'yes' or 'no', okay? So we're really starting from nothing here. Okay, I can make this work. You're on the plan after all. What's your name, by the way?"

She suddenly felt very uncomfortable not responding, but couldn't and wouldn't form the words. She could only think to point at her mouth and wave her hands to indicate no.

"What's that supposed to mean? You don't talk? Is that it? Not a word? Well, that sly... Now I see why you're here. Guess they think you're pretty good at keeping secrets. I certainly keep my fair share, but I guess even I'm a risk."

Now that Max had her secret to carry, she set to work teaching her what her job would be here--mixing drinks in the Sandpiper Lounge for...someone. She still wasn't entirely sure, and Max didn't let on, who would actually be consuming these drinks. She assumed she would find out soon enough.

In the meantime, she learned the basics of mixing cocktails, "the regulars for the regulars," as Max called them. She started to lose track of time in the lounge and only figured it to be later in the day as more people began filling the dining room. She could just catch a glimpse of the people sitting at the table, but could tell that the people seemed well-dressed and very clean.

As the room became more full, she found it harder and harder to concentrate. She wasn't used to hearing so many voices at the same time. Her life had been reduced to only the basic sounds that a person could make, and usually only one of those at that. Perhaps noticing her distraction, Max pointed her off to the side to rack with glasses and a sink. "Why don't you focus on something else and wash these glasses." When you're done, you can take a quick break. There's a door to the kitchen over there." Max pointed to a door that was the same color as the walls, barely noticeable if you didn't know where to look.

With the glasses cleaned, she passed through the door into a large kitchen area filled with shiny silver kitchen equipment--enormous stoves and cooktops. Lines of sinks with large sprayers attached. Food prep and serving stations. Everything a kitchen like this would have needed to operate. There were a handful of people working in the kitchen, but it was obvious that the kitchen could have handled many more people.

One of the kitchen workers, a woman with her hair up in a net, looked up at her and pointed to the back. As if knowing why she was there, the woman was pointing her towards small room with a char and window out ont the kitchen. It must have been an office at some point, but now seemed to serve as the staff's breakroom. There was a single metal chair with roughly textured cloth seat and back. The back wobbled when she sat down and tried to lean against it. Instead of a desk, there was a small round table next to the chair with a lamp, ash tray, and a few old magazines on it. The magazines were dog eared and faded. One had its cover taped and retaped to it. Sitting in the chair, she pulled her legs up and rested her head on her knees.

Just as her eyes started to close, a suprised voice woke her up. "Ah, sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here." Frozen in mid-stride, a young man about her age stood here, same uniform as everyone else. His hair was trimmed and his face smoothly shaved. She dedicated some kind of accent, but couldn't place it. "I didn't mean to bother you. My name is Alex," instinctively he held out his hand to shake, but she declined it.

"That's okay, I get it. It's pretty different around here. You're new right?" She shook her head. He leaned in, "I heard you can't talk. That must be weird." She smiled in response. "I know, it's crazy how word gets around. But that's what's it like. Like I said, it's different here. But, I've only got a few minutes to take a break, so I'll just..."

Before he could finish, she got up and slipped past him to return to the lounge. "Oh okay, you didn't have to..." but he was already drowned out by the clash and clatter of kitchen sounds.

She resumed her place back in the lounge. Max wasn't in the lounge at the moment. She could see her standing out in the dining room, talking to someone else in uniform. She wondered how people knew about her already. Xavier? Max? She felt like she trusted Max more already, given that Max was already starting to warm to her.

When Max returned back to the bar, she said, "First shift will be starting soon, so get ready."

Within a few minutes the people began to filter in to the lounge. One man sat at the bar. Another group--two men of roughly the same age--sat in a far off table. Max took her around the room and introduced her as "the new girl." They all said pleasant enough "how do you dos," even if they were tinged with hungry tones.

They took drink orders and went back to the bar to start mixing drinks. The man at the bar only asked for bourbon neat, and Max let her take care of that herself. The man at the bar, acknowledged her with a head nod and nuzzled into the comfort the drink seemed to be giving him.

Things continued this way into the evening, when Max finally turned to her and said, "That's enough for your first day. I'd say it was time for you to head back and get ready for tomorrow."

She wasn't expecting to be shown the door so soon, but could feel the wear and tear of working, of being watched by so many people. It was as if existing in this bubble of a normal world was more trying and taxing that the world that really existed.

She turned to leave through the lounge's front door, but Max gently held her back by the arm, "No, honey, we leave by the back door. Enter that way too." So, she dodged her way through the kitchen again, down a narrow hallway to a door with a small pane of glass criss-crossed by wire.

She leaned into the crashbar and entered into the chill of the early evening air. The early evening light that accompanied the early evening air still made her eyes flinch. She had been inside the Sandpiper's dim four walls so so many hours now. Even though the air and light was startling, and she hugged herself in the chill, her body suddenly felt looser than it had. She felt the weight of working lift from her. Again, she could hardly believe that she felt this way out in the open, exposed to the world. But here she was, wearing a uniform, walking back to the barebones cabin, seemingly part of some oasis of the old world that someone willed into existence.

# Ch 15: Imposters #

She woke in the morning in a daze, hardly aware that she had even fallen asleep the night before. The cabin seemed colder than before, even under the threadbare blanket that had been placed over her. The old man was already up and getting dressed. "Good you're finally awake. I'm expected to report for work soon. When are you due back?" She shrugged in response.

"I heard you were assigned to some kind of bar or something," he said. Again, she was surprised that she was the subject of so much discussion. "You're really the talk of the town, so to speak. Apparently working the bar as a new arrival is very unusual."

She smiled a weak, half-smile, mostly amused that people could take something like being assigned to serve drinks so seriously.

"I better get going. You should too. Let's not give them any reason to think much of us. The more we can fade into the background the better. I'm hoping I can learn enough to figure out our next move." With that he swung through the thin door, leaving her propped on one elbow and rubbing sleep from her eyes.

She got up and got dressed in her uniform. This time she grabbed her coat, which had been cleaned and returned already to the cabin. Stepping outside, she entered a world that was already bustling with work. Workers were sweeping the walks, clearing leaves.

She looked ahead and noticed Max coming walking down the steps from the hotel's verandah towards the beach. She was carrying a tray that must have had drinks on it. She traced Max's path towards the beach and noticed two women walking on the beach heading towards a covered with a few tables and chairs she had not noticed before. Getting closer, she noticed that this covered area seemed to connect to a dock and a small building on the water.

She continued on to the hotel and entered the back door she now knew existed and hung up her coat inside. The idea of working for days and days in the Sandpiper was not a thrilling one to her. She had a hard time imaging being able to be confined in those walls with those people serving their drinks, smiling at their jokes, ignoring their whispered conversations. Nevertheless, she took up her station behind the bar and began the day's prep work that Max had shown her.

Several days, a week, maybe more passed this way. The old man leaving early. She spending her days in the Sandpiper Lounge, leaving at night to return exhausted, wanting nothing more than to smoother herself in silence. She couldn't remember the last time she had been around so much talking and noise. Some days it was all she could do to smile through the riot of noise that filled the dark lounge.

In spite of this, she started to anticipate the daily routine, the singular sameness of things. She sometimes found seeing the faces that she recognized to be comforting. Max had grown more comfortable around her too, and would tell her stories about life in the motel while they worked. Max even let little fragments of her own life slip out from time to time.

The old man didn't share her sense of comfort. He even commented on it, urging her to not be complacent, to be aware of what was going on. He seemed much more concerned about being there and more motivated to leave. After a lecture like this, she would lay there, pressed in to the cheap mattress under the faded comforters piled on top of her and wondered if they really did need to leave.

Max's hand gripping her arm one day, jolted her out of this complacent lull. "You need to come with me," and led her out of the lounge, this time through the front door.

They turned sharply to the right, away from the hotel's room towards a stair case that led down in a spiral swoop. The stairs were short and oddly spaced apart, causing them to trot down them as much as walk. She ran her hand along the smoothed railing as they went.

At the bottom of the stairs, they passed through two closed double door and into a part of the hotel she didn't realize existed. This must have been some kind of conference space. They walked down a hallway with doors oddly spaced out. At the end of the hall, a man she didn't recognize stood outside the door.

He turned when he saw them approaching, "Is this the girl?" Max nodded. He opened the door to them.

She gasped as they stepped inside the room. A table was overturned and rolled away into the corner. A few broken chairs lay scattered about the twining pattern of the gold, red, and blue carpet.

In the middle of the room, the old man sat in one of these broken chairs, slumped over. She tried to run to him, but Max held her back, before letting her go, and whispering to her, "Don't move; don't do anything."

"Good there she is," another voice said. She turned and realized that Xavier was in the room, along a man who appeared to be a guard like the one outside the room, and another person, who she vaguely recognized as one of the motel's residence. He was plump and middle aged and wore a track suit, in the fashion of most of the other male residents.

She was shocked by they way Xavier held himself now. He was no longer the rigid, proper manager. He seemed looser, out of control. Violence crackled around him like electricity. He pointed at the girl and swiped his finger to towards the old man. The guard edged Max away from her and gave her a push towards the old man.

She stumbled at first but regained her balance. Standing next to him, she could tell that he had been beaten from the clots of blood in his hair. She wanted to try to comfort him but realized that this would be a mistake.

Xavier stepped forward and said, "I have one simple question for you: What are you?" She looked pleadingly at Max. She couldn't answer this question; she wouldn't be able to form the words. "Do I need to repeat myself? Who are you?"

All she could do was hand her head in silence as a response. Max stepped forwad, "Xavier, you know she doesn't talk."

"Are we sure? Could be an act for all we know?"

"I've been working with her for weeks now and nothing. Not a syllable. What is this all about?"

The man, the resident, sprang alive, as if on cue, "I caught this...this ruffian...trying to break into my room and..."

Xavier cut him off, "And we took possession of him, I took it upon myself to investigate further into who this man, and this girl, might be." He passed what looked like an ID card, the kind that had been issued as things were starting to go bad in the early days, "This visitor is not the one we were expecting. They're imposters. And I want to know who sent them."

The old man limply raised his head, "We're nobodies, just nobodies."

"Well Jeremiah is the one who picked them up, why aren't you having words with him."

"Jeremiah is characteristically sloppy, but useful. I will deal with him in my own way, and I won't be questioned by the likes of you."

"The likes of me?" was Max's reply. "We'll see about that." She stormed out of the room, leaving the old man and her alone. At least with Max in the room, she felt some measure of comfort. Now she didn't know what would happen in this room, hidden in the depths of the hotel, away from everyone and everything.

But it didn't take long for Max to return, at least that was her guess by what she coudl hear in the hallway, "Sir, sir, no I wouldn't advise."

A man's voice replied, "You mean I'm not allowed to enter an area of my hotel?"

"No sir that's not..."

Before the guard could finish, the door swung back open and the man from the beach, the owner and proprietor of Paz-A-Lago appeared with Max. He scanned the room and turned to Xavier, "Xavier, explain what's going on? Max tells me that there has a great misunderstanding."

"Of course, sir," Xavier replied. Already in the presence of [man's name], Xavier's manner was more like stiff, proper manager than this terrifying inquisitor.

"Well, go ahead and explain what's happening..."

"These people are imposters, sir."

"Imposters? How do you know?"

"I found this man's ID card and it didn't match our manifest."

"Didn't match our manifest and you do this?" he replied, looking straight at her. "Now it seems to me that this has been some kind of misunderstanding."

"I understand, but if these people aren't who they say there are..."

"Let's not forget, Xavier, that people out there, they use all kinds of names. Who's to say the names on that manifest are correct? Besides, I've been watching this one for several weeks now and she's fitting right in. Max even vouches for her, don't you, Max."

"I do. She's a hard worker. I haven't heard anythink about her companion."

This gave the resident an opportunity to step in, "Are you calling me a liar? I saw him..."

But [name] cut the resident off, "Jerry, calm down. Again, I'm sure this is a misunderstanding. He must have heard his orders wrong. Pure and simple. Let me go treat you to a drink and we can put this all behind us." He had his arm around Jerry now, as if forcibly leading him out of the room. "Leave them to tend to the old man and get him back to the cabins, Xavier."

"Yes, sir." Xavier retreated from the room with the two guards.

Before he left with the resident, [name] turned and looked her in the eyes, "I'm sorry you had to see this. I really don't want you to get the wrong impression," and he left.

When they were out of earshot, she rushed to the old man and looked him over. One of his eyes was swelling and he had a cut lip. She started to try to lift him from the chair, but Max was standing beside her know, holding both by the shoulders, training her eyes into hers. "I don't know who you are, and I don't care. I meant what I said. You're a good worker. You could be very comfortable here. But you need to get him in line. No more poking around, no more asking questions."

As if to break through the confused look on her face, Max continued, "That's right. There's been rumors about him. I just didn't say anything because I though it would come to this. Everyone is a little curious about the way things are when they first arrive. But it doesn't usually come to this, and it did come to this. And it can't anymore. I have a little bit of sway here with the residents, especially with [name]. But I've played that card now, so keep that in mind before either of you decides to do something stupid."

With that, Max let go of her and helped her pick up the old man. They got him back up the stairs and out a side door. Alex was coming up the walk and rushed forward to help. Max handed over her side of the old man's limp body and said, "I'll get some ice and a few supplies. I'll meet you in your cabin."

Alex didn't say anything while they dragged the old man back, but once they were inside and set him down on his matress, he stepped back and said, "Wow, they got him in a bad way. What happened?" He looked over at her and shook his head, "Right, you can't say."

She sat down on her side of the room, collapsed would be more accurate. He came and sat down next to her. "It'll be okay. This...this is just something you get used to living here. Not that anyone talks about it, not openly like this. They've got code words and know how about things without really talking about it. Like a secret language. Blike ba bsebcret blanbguage."

He smiled at her bewildered look, "You never had a secret language when you were a kid? My mom used to talk to me in her secret language all the time. I sometimes talk to myself this way. I have to remind myself to switch over and stop talking this way sometimes. Anyway, I really should be getting back to work. They're going to wonder where I am, then I'll be in his shoes." Alex paused, "Too soon? Right I better go."

He headed to the door, started to open it, then paused. "But before I do, can I tell you a quick story?" She nodded. "Okay, not many people know this, so you know...well of course you do. Anyway, I came here with someone, just like you. My uncle. I had been separated from my mom and dad, but my uncle managed to find me in a camp. He had heard about a place where you could work a job and things were generally okay. We traveled for days to get here, might have been weeks, for all I know."

Alex made a small pacing circle as he told the story, "At first everything was fine. I was doing lots of errands and chores around the place. Sometimes helping out residence with little jobs they gave me. I was basically a kid, so it seemed pretty cool to be running around this place. It wasn't a horror show like where we came from."

He continued on, "But my uncle. My uncle was different. He was a proud man, didn't want to be told what to do by anyone. He had really gotten into the whole 'don't tread on me' mentality. Didn't take the warnings seriously when things started to get bad, people dying and all that."

"So take a guy like that and put him here. Didn't take long before he had had enough. One night, he thought he was being quiet and sneaking out, but I could hear him. I kept my back to him, but I was so still. I didn't move a muscle. I don't even know why. He wasn't going to take me with him, but maybe I worried if I woke up then he would change his mind. But I didn't move and he left into the night, to make his escape."

"It was weird thinking that the last member of my family was walking out the door. Maybe I wouldn't see him ever again. And there he went, and I didn't do a thing, didn't say a thing. And once I heard the gunshots firing a few minutes later, I knew I never would."

"After that night, my uncle never appeared again. No one said a word about him, not even Max, who will tell you to it straight if she trusts you. Not even her, in fact, she couldn't even look me in the eyes for a few days. I don't know if she was ashamed or scared or what. Anyway, the moral of the story is that it could be worse. You're lucky he's just beat up and not dead."

Just as Alex was leaving, Max returned with a towel twisted around a few cubes of ice, some clean water, and a few bandages. "It's not much, but it'll do for now." She cleaned his wounds under Max's supervision, then sat next to him keeping the ice compressed against his swollen eye. "Keep it there for a while. He'll be okay. You need to make sure you get rest. I need you ready to hustle tomorrow. There'll be more eyes on you now. No room for error, understood?"

She shook her head, not so much for agreement, but for comprehension. At that moment, she didn't think she could fall asleep and go back into the lounge and be the silent witness to the men's  gossip and bad behavior. But, as she got more tired and could feel the trickle of melting ice running down her hand, she couldn't see an immediate way out their situation. Like she had done so many times before, she was able to coerce her fear and doubt into hardened resignation. With that inert feeling coming over her, she finally fell asleep.


Ch 16: The Visitor

Within a few days, the old man was well enough to return to work. He was put on the "landscape detail" at first which required him to be outside and a distance from the hotel. After weeks of this, winter had set in fully and the landscape detail was reduced down to a few people. He wasn't given a heavy coat or gloves or much protection from the cold.

The mornings were particularly cruel now and exposed just how flimsy the cabins were. She awoke each morning enveloped in the exhaled clouds from her breath. She would dash down the paths to the warm refuge of the kitchen and lounge, spend her days doing what she had done the day before and the day before that.

She hardly saw the old man anymore. He was gone in the mornings before she woke up and rarely returned before she crashed asleep. It wasn't until several months had passed and winter was showing the first signs of breaking the cloudy gloom it cast over the lake and everything else, that he spoke to her.

It was another morning, sunnier than usual, but still crisp and cold. As she was leaving for the morning, she thought she saw the old man out of the corner of her eye, standing back in the trees that surrounded the cabins, only to thin out into the beach. She wondered what he was doing and so she veered off course to try to find him.

She realized that she was walking a path that cut through the trees, thin and poorly defined as it was. After only a minute of walking, she found him, waiting for her, leaning against a tree.

"Good, I wasn't sure if you had seen me." She stared back at him blankly, not entirely sure why there were standing here on a crack of a hiking path out of view of the hotel. "These paths crisscross the whole area. There's even a clearing where some of the workers go to get away from the hotel," he explained.

Of course he had gotten to know the area around the hotel better since he had spent the last few months outside working. This was a fine guided tour of the grounds, but she didn't couldn't tell where he was heading.

"It's a quiet place to meet out here. Probably no one listening in," he said. As if in response to her puzzled look he replied, "I know you think I sound unhinged. But I've been hearing things and learning things. Believe me, we only got a glimpse of what goes on around here that day."

He started to pace on the trail as he talked to her, as if becoming more uncomfortable, "I know I haven't been around much. It's just been easier to keep focused on work and not to worry about you much."

She wasn't sure how to respond to this. "The weather's getting nicer and I figure we need to plan our escape soon." She nodded in agreement.

"But I've heard that some important visitor will be here in a few days. I think you'll be able to get the inside track on who this person is. Apparently only the most important residents are able to make use of that bar where you're working."

Obviously, the old man had been hard at work collecting information. "Maybe when you get back we'll be able to figure out what's going on and make a plan. But for now, I'm going to keep my head down and get to work. But it ain't easy working like this after what I've been through."

He took a deep breath, "But we've got to carry on just a little longer... I have to carry on. Will you be okay?" She nodded yes. "Good," replied. "I have to go and you should get inside before they start to wonder about you."

He left in alone in the woods. Not sure what else to do with herself, started back toward the hotel. A few workers waved to her now as she walked along. Somehow the secret knowledge that they would be trying to find a way to leave, made the workers' friendly gestures seemed emptier now. She almost felt bad and had an urge to run to them and shake them and say, "Wake up, come with us." But she wouldn't do that, and more likely than not, they wouldn't want her to either.

She found her way back to the service entrance to the kitchen. The echoing clatter of dishes greeted her, along with a hot wave of air from the kitchen. She was hungry and figured that she would scrounge for a something quick to eat to tamp down the hunger she felt. She entered the kitchen to find Max, a man she had seen in passing in the kitchen, and another woman.

Max looked her over, "Well you look a little better than you did yesterday evening. Don't worry you'll get used to it. Hungry?" She nodded. "Carl usually fixes the kitchen staff something to eat in the morning before our shifts start." The other woman dragged a stool over to the large stainless steel table in the middle of the room where they were sitting.

Once she sat down, Carl put a plate of what looked like the most traditional breakfast imaginable in front of her. Steaming eggs, bacon that still seemed to sizzle around the edges, and two perfect triangles of toast.

She stared at the plate in wonder, as if she had been shown the most precious artifact that had been hidden away, undiscovered, in some obscure vault. "It's okay to eat it, you know," Max said.

The other woman nudged Max's arm, "You don't give her a hard time. You've been here so long you don't remember what those first days are like..."

"Well it's not like you arrived just yesterday yourself," Max replied.

The other woman looked at her, "I'm going on a year, but you wouldn't know it from the way this one treats me. My name is Rosario, by the way. I heard you don't talk, so you don't have to worry about saying anything. Just eat up."

As she ate the simple, luxuriously hot breakfast, she listened to their chatter about people and their antics, people who must have lived in the hotel. One story involved some complicated deception, but she couldn't keep the people straight, leaving her without any idea who had done what.

Even though she couldn't follow the intricate ins and outs of their conversation, she was aware of how all of the little details about life inside the hotel shut out everything else. These people, sitting on hard stools around the stainless steel table, stealing a few moments for themselves before their days full of work began seemed content, even happy. The scenes of terror and ravage had fallen from their faces.

These were survivors, but not like the survivors she was used to scurrying past at a distance, never sure if someone's desperation would lead them to do something previously unthinkable. She certainly had. She wouldn't dwell on it, but she knew it. Even the memory of the crashed flattened car and weak cries for help flashed in her mind. She had so thoroughly learned to ignore such pleas for the traps they might be. Until the old man washed up in her life. Now she was here, on this journey, waylaid in this strange hotel, carried on a current charged with something between hope and despair.

"Hey, ready to get to work," Max said, shaking her shoulder gently. She obviously had been lost in some kind of reverie thinking about these people and this situation. Even the luxury of losing herself in thought struck her. "It's time. Busy day today."

Rosario helpfully cleared her plate, "That's right, new shipments coming in today. Big time trader, I hear. I bet Carl here can't wait to stock up." Carl just laughed and nodded as he cleaned dishes.

Back in the lounge, she and Max started up the routine she began learning the day before--washing, arranging, getting ready for the guests. Max always called them guests, never customers. She hadn't seen any money trading hands, so room charges or credit cards, no barter even, which would have been much more likely. Or if there was barter it happened at some time and place that wasn't obvious to her.

She kept at her work, occasionally wondering what the hold man was doing. But there wasn't much time for this. She had recipes to learn, citrus to prepare, "Not many of these left," Max said, turning over a lemon in her hand. "We'll see if we get more today. Mr. Hawthorne enjoys a twist in his drinks."

As the morning proceeded, she learned a bit more about Max, but not much. She never said much about the hotel, speaking in vague generalities, or specifics that didn't make much sense, like who Mr. Hawthorne may or may not be. It was clear already that Max had been at the hotel for a while now and was trusted, even relied upon in some ways.

It was also clear that the Sandpiper Lounge served an important role in the hotel. When this visitor arrived, he was expected to spend a good deal of time in the lounge. She had to wait until that he arrived to understand what exactly that would mean.

Starting around lunch time, guests started filtering in to the Lounge, sometimes alone, sometimes with a small group, like before. She recognized a few faces from the day before, but there were a few new ones too. There were introduces, pleasantries, mild flirtations from men much older than her, and drinks. Many drinks.

The mood seemed to be almost festive today, but the talk much more whispered between visitors. From the fragments she could pickup, much of the whispering had to do with today's guest and the shipment.

Finally, the moment that had been the subject of so much speculation arrived. She only realized what was happening when she saw Xavier enter the lounge and talk to Max. Max nodded her over and said, "The visitor is here and we're supposed to assemble outside."

At the time, she cleaning glasses in the small bar sink. She tried to rinse the acrid smell of cleaner from her hands, then dried them off to follow Max outside.

She hadn't seen the front of the hotel since their arrival. All of the hotel's workers must have been standing in the semi-cicular drive in a neat and orderly line. Xavier took extra care to ensure that it was in fact a tight, orderly line. She glanced over and saw the old man, looking worn from his day's work, but alert and ready to absorb whatever new information he could. He quickly acknowledged her, but snapped back to attention.

At first the sounds was faint, but then grew louder. She could hear the creak and clop of horses and carts approaching from the road. The driver that had brought them here was the first to round the corner, followed by another cart. Both were filled with barrels and boxes, sacks of goods. She couldn't remember the last time she had seen so much...abundance assembled in one place.

Finally another horse and cart appeared, but this one was more like a carriage, really more like a stagecoach that she had seen in old picture books of the wild west. Several men on horses trotted alongside the carriage, with rifles cradled loosely in their arms.

The three carriages and horsemen came to a stop in front of the hotels. She found it strange to see these rustic, dusty carts and horses stopped in front of the hotel's concrete, metal, and steel. The horses stamped and padded on the ground while the cart drivers and horsemen were still.

Xavier stepped out from the semi-circle of workers and approached the carriage. He flipped down a square of metal beams that was mounted to the carriages side by crude, but very strong looking bolts. Xavier opened the carriage door and the carriage passenger stepped down from the carriage, onto the step, and then graced the concrete.

The passenger wore a long flowing coat over a dark colored suit. He wore a tie, knotted loosely under a once stiff color. The man wasn't as clean cut as the men she has seen in the hotel, but he did have the same comfortable, well-kept look about him. He seemed at ease, completely in control, not at all worried about the horrors that stalked the everyday world.

"Impressive," the man said, looking at the staff. "Many mouths to feed. I hope my supplies will keep all these helping hands healthy and productive for you."

"No doubt Lord Grainger," Xavier replied.

"So where are my esteemed hosts?" the visiter, Lord Grainger, replied.

"They should be here shortly..."

Just then the hotel doors opened. She looked over her shoulder and caught a glimpse of the man from the beach, holding the arm of an older woman. She wore a long flowing dress, flowery like a beach dress, even in this early winter weather. She wore large sun glasses. Gold and jewels glinted from every possible place on her body.

"See mother," the younger man said, "I told you he would arrive exactly when he meant to."

"Not on time, I would say," the woman, apparently his bother replied with a tone that even from a distance, she could hear the acid in it.

"Mother, be generous. Lord Grainger is our best and most reliable supplier. Let's be nice, mmmkay?"

They both stepped half way down the walk and took a few steps down, but stopped, like royalty, waiting for the visitor to approach them. The visitor had an amused look, but also tinged with annoyance, but conceded to their postion by advancing the rest of the way towards them. He shook the man's hand and kissed the woman's. "A please to visit Paz-al-Lago, as always," he said.

"As always, we're pleased to have you here, Lord Grainger," the man said. "Let's let Xavier coordinate the help and get everything in order. I believe I owe you a drink from your last visit."

"Yes, I recall that. I wouldn't say no to one after my journey."

That was the cue for the workers to resume their work. Xavier led first and the rest of the group followed. She fell in behind Max and followed her back to the Sandpiper.

For the first time in her brief time there, the lounge was brimming with visitors. A cheer went up as soon as she and Max entered the lounge with orders being shout out and lost in the din. "Get to work collecting those orders, it's going to be a busy day," Max whispered to her.

Doing as she was told, she started circulating around the room and collecting orders. More than once she was pulled onto a lap, chatted up, and endured the veiled banter that passed between the men in the lounge, not directed at her, but about her.

After an hour or so, the visitor and the man, who had presented himself as some kind of leader of the motel community, appeared in the lounge. Cheers and cries of triumph errupted in the room.

She was in the midst of setting down drinks when glass started to clink in the lounge. Calls for a speech rang out. She didn't realize he was even nearby, but she realized that the leader's arm was suddenly wrapped around her waist. He gave little tug, the sligthest of pulls that could hardly be construed as such, but which altered her motion from walking away to being fixed by his side, causing the remaining drink on her plate to slosh.

The leader took the least drink from her tray, raised a glass and started his toast, "What started as just an idea, a dream born in the dark days in a dark shelter, has now become a shining refuge for believers like us." A few "here here" went up. "Everything that was is behind us, we only have, and enjoy, what is here and now. But this dream wouldn't be possible without the tireless efforts of Lord Grainger." More clinking and clapping and "here heres."

"He brings us everything we need from the outside, and nothing we don't. I don't know how he does what he does, and certainly don't want to know, but he does it. And because of his efforts, we live the dream. To Lord Grainger."

"To Lord Grainger," the crowd responded and emptied their glasses. As if on cue, she was released from the leader's embrace and with another gentle push was propelled back to the bar to fill the now empty glasses.

It was many hours later before Max finally released her from the lounge. At this point, there were only a few straggler left. "I'll see them out myself," she said. Released into the dark, cold night, she stumbled back to the cabin, ready to toss herself onto the cold, makeshift bed with impeccable sheets.

When she opened the door and stepped inside, she could tell, even in the dark, that something wasn't right. Something was missing. She scanned the room and realized that the old man wasn't there. Immediately, her mind rushed to the worse scenarios. He was injured. He was dead.

A flurry of possible actions swarmed her mind. She had to find him. She had to do something. All she could think of immediately was to leave the cabin, to move. The door's creaking seemed more ominous as she pushed her way through. Standing on the roughly build stairs, she looked around. There were other cabins around them, the quarters for the rest of the workers. Maybe she could find Rosario's cabin, or maybe Alex's.

She approached the nearest cabin and gave a gentle knock on the door, not wanting to wake the entire work crew up, no matter how upset she felt. She knocked one more, this time with a bit more force so the door hopped in its frame.

Even with this more forceful knock, no one answered. She tried another cabin. No one answered that one either. Same with the third. She paused in the midst of approaching the fourth, realizing that something else was going on and that continuing to knock on doors wasn't going to help her arrive at answers any more quickly.

She stood there in the dark, irresolute, the swirl of possible actions still overwhelming her. She started when a voice behind her said, "Lost something?" She turned to see one of the riders from the Count's entourage walking towards him. "It's okay. If you're looking for everyone, I know where they are. Follow me."

He walked past her towards, following the path between the houses to trail that cut a murky line in the dark woods. She could hardly tell that there was a path to take, but he seemed confident of where he was going, so she followed him into the woods.

She could tell they were heading away from the water. At one point, the brush cleared enough that she could see the faint outline of an old parking lot through the trees. They kept going, however, further down the path.

They continued for a while longer until she could hear a faint din of voices in the distance. They reached a clearing in the woods. Here she found herself surrounded by people, people she recognized but who seemed out of place. These people seemed loose and carefree. They weren't bound up in the generic hotel uniforms they all wore. These people were wearing their clothes from the other world, the clothes that represented the real version of themselves.

Farthest from her, a small group was dancing while another played a harmonica. Most of the people here were huddled in small groups, around small fires, drinking from cups, trying to keep warm. When she appeared in the clearing with the man, a cheer went up. The man held up a bottle, which she hadn't even noticed he was carrying before now. He unscrewed the top and sent the bottle around for people to refill their drinks.

A red cheeked woman who had been dancing broke off from that group and moved to towards them. Before the man who brought the bottle was pulled awy, he said to her, "A celebration. That was all. Only time they get to."

With that he went twirling away with the dancing woman. She looked around and saw the old man talking with a few older men like himself, sitting on stumps and fragments of chairs. He stood up when she approached, "Are you okay? You look like you are scared to death." She shook her head to indicate that she was okay.

He pulled her away from the group and spoke quietly to her, "I'm sorry I didn't tell you where I was going, but there was no way to send you a message in the lounge. No one would do it, not even Alex." She saw Alex over the old man's shoulder. She made eye contact with Alex, causing him to smile and nod in her direction. "Here," the old man said, handing her his cup, "take this and drink up. It'll make you feel better."

Even though she had had her fill of sight and sounds of drinks, she tipped up the cup and felt the hot burn of the whiskey down her throat. This wasn't an entirely new sensation, but not one she had experienced many times before. In the smokey crisp cold, the smolder of alcohol moving through her was comforting and put her at ease. She followed him back to his conversation circle and absorbed the convivial atmosphere.

Twenty or thirty minutes passed and the day's labors were starting to bear down on her. She could feel herself nodding off while the other were talking. She had no idea how these people who worked do hard from sun up to sun down could muster so much energy to dance and talk and drink. Realizing that she was so tired, the old man told the group that they were heading back to their cabins.

He helped prop her up to standing. They sat off down the path.
He didn't say much as they walked. It wasn't long before she realized that someone was following them. The old man either didn't notice or didn't care. They turned off the path abruptly and stopped at the point where the shrubbery and trees gave way to beach.

They turned to see the rider that had been in the clearing appearing in half-toned shades of moonlight and shadow.

When the old man realized what was happening, he stopped and turned and waited for the rider. As the rider grew closer, he looked at the old man and said, "Mr. Novak, is that you?"

"Casey?" the old man replied.

"Yes, sir, it's me," the rider replied., "'Course no one calls me that now."

"Well I remember a doughy faced boy playing with my son in the alley. Look at you know."

"Hardened, like all of us. But I recognized you immediately, as soon as we arrived in front of the hotel."

Pausing their conversation, the old man turned to her to paraphrase what was happening, though she was starting to get up to speed. "Casey was a friend of my son's. Used to come around in the afternoons until his parents got home from work. Now he's..."

"Muscle for Lord Grainger. I know what you're thinking."

"I'm not thinking anything. You're surviving. That's what we're all doing."

"What are you doing here? This is the last place I expected to see you. And who is..."

"Just someone I met along the way. She saved me actually from a watery death. I'm trying to head north to find Nick. Last I heard he had been round up and sent there."

"To the plants?"

From the way Casey said that she could tell that being at the plants was probably not a good thing. "Something wrong with that? I've heard stories of course."

"Stories probably don't do justice to what it's like up there. It's pretty rough, and I've seen some rough stuff, done some rough stuff out there."

"Well now's not the time to air our sins. It seemed like you had something you wanted to say to me. I kept seeing you look over my way."

"I don't know. I guess I couldn't help it, I was just surprised is all. Surprised you were here."

"We aren't planning on staying."

"Might be harder to leave then you think."

"Why's that? We've only been here a few days. Place seems little off, but what isn't?"

"The folks in charge don't take kindly to the help wandering off. They don't word getting out about what they have going on around here."

"They let this Lord Grainger in and out."

"Well we'll call that extenuating circumstances. None of this would be possible if it weren't for what my employer does."

"And what is that?"

"Whatever it takes. You'd surprised how networks and markets are coming back to live. People are getting bolder now, more willing to take chances, risk things. Especially when there is profit involved."

"Where's the profit coming from?"

"I don't have time to explain the whole thing, but this place...it attracted a lot of wealthy people. There's a vault and everything. They're got all kind of rarities and riches that my employer can barter with."

"But what about Nick?"

"I have no idea. I do know that they're rounding up more and more people and taking them north to the plants. Paz-a-Lago isn't the only place popping up demanding power."

"Do that's where the power's coming from?"

Casey shook his head, "They're trying to light up everything in this area, for a price. It sounds like running the power plants takes a lot of hands. But like I said, it's grim up there."

"Can you get us there?"

"Lord Grainger doesn't exactly take on passengers..."

"Then just tell us how to get there, there's got to be a way up there."

"Look Mr. Novak, I would like to help, but things get really rough from here on out. I mean scary rough..."

"I've been through it. She's been through it."

"Not like this, it's like nothing you've seen. If you're not armed and ready to fight, you'll either get shot or impressed into labor. You're best bet is to make amends with this place and hunker down with the rest of the workers. Ride out your days here. It's not a bad place to be, especially once the weather improves."

The old man seemed resolved to ignore this advice, "I can't do that. My son is out there and I need to find him. I promised him I would find him. There has to be a way."

But your friend Max," he said pointing at her, "might be the person to get you out of here."

# Ch 17 Teatro del Lago #

Ever since that night, she had turned over the plan in her mind again and again. She didn't know if it would work, but it seemed like the only the opportunity they would have to make a clean break from the hotel.

Casey had explained that the annual Teatro del Lago was coming up. It was some kind of masked ball and performance that drew out all of the hotel residence. The festivities continued for several days, "like a Roman party," Casey had explained. Normally Lord Grainger was invited to celebrate the opening of trade routes in the early spring, but this year he was called away and had declined the invitation.

"But the Teatro, that will be your opportunity," Casey explained.

The night after Casey left with Lord Grainger's caravan, the old man returned earlier than usual to the cabin. He seemed to have something bundled under his arms, but he held it tightly and closely. After gently closing the door, he looked around, kneeled down beside her, and unwrapped the package, revealing a small, blunt nose pistol inside.

The old man held it up, inspected it, opened the chamber and looked inside. He seemed pleased with it, so she assumed it was in good working order. "This will be the key to us getting out of here," he said. "Help me find a place to hide it." They searched around the cabin until the old man found a gap in the way the door had been roughly framed out in two by fours of varying lengths. With the way they had been slapdahsed together, he would slip the gun between the door frame and the outer plywod wall. If you knew and were looking carefully, you could just make out the tip of the pistol's grip, but its dark black and brown colors blended in with the wood and shadows in the cabin.

With the gun secured, they let it sit there until it was time to put the plan into action. It didn't mean she wasn't always aware of the gun, always watching it instead of trying to fall asleep. It was pointless the train so much attention on it, she realized. The gun unsettled her like it might take on a life of its own, or even be found and then be a secret that someone held in their possession, holding it, waiting to use it, not the gun, but the secret, which would be just as deadly of a weapon when wielded by the right person.

At last the night of the Teatro was announced, out on the verandah with all of the residents assembled after the dinner hour. She hadn't seen everyone who lived in the motel together at once like this. Scanning the crowd the faces were almost indistinct from one another, even though she registered some male and female faces, some subtle differences in race and background. But taken together the resident of Paz-a-Lago seemed remarkably like one another.

The news that the Teatro would be held in two days animated the crowd. Groups broke into smaller groups to discuss their plans. These people, who lived their lives with a singular devotion to their pleasure and relaxation, seemed to find the thought of enjoying even more of it to be thrilling.

For her and the other workers, the Teatro meant a wave of frenetic energy crashed over all of them. Every worker seemed to hold more tension in their bodies, every movement was more exact than even the day before. Faces that normally would have broken in to a fleeting smile or nod of recognition were hardened and focused, as if not wanting to forget a single detail.

She was called on to help with food preparation and laundry. So much laundry. The hotel's large commercial washing machines usually chugged along at a leisurely pace, able to handle the light work given it. But suddenly it seemed that everything needed to be laundered and pressed crisp from napkins to tablecloths to intricately sewn and pleated dresses and shirts. In fact, some of the women who tended to the rooms and acted like maids from long ago would have to some of the women who lived in the hotel, were given temporary roles as costumers and seamstresses.

Outside the hotel changed too. Workers transplanted trees and shrubbery in large pots. Furniture was arranged into sitting areas with partitions built around them. And running through everything were lights.

The day before, she was surprised to see Max waiting for her outside, even more of a surprise was to see the old man standing next to her. "We've got outside work to do today," Max explained. "Follow me" The old man avoided looking at her directly. She followed his lead and kept a distance from him and tried to keep her focus away from him as well.

They followed Max along the walk that ran parallel to the beach until the reached the dock and the small boat house. The boat house had been locked up since they had arrived, so she had never seen inside it. Now the doors were opened wide, revealing a few old kayaks, stand up paddle boards, and a small boat with an outboard motor. Even without looking, she could tell that the old man had seen the motor boat and was very aware of the potential that it represented for escape.

she had to push ideas about that away. They had to set up the exterior bar. The old man was there to haul tables stored in the boat house out and set them up . Max directed her to begin moving large rolling carts of glassware in plastic racks, relics of the hotel's former life hosting large events. They used bins to create temporary sinks. They even relocated the ice maker to the boat house.

When the day of the Teatreo arrived, she was exhausted, but had to prepare for the long day ahead. Max had warned her that the festivities could last into the next day sometimes.

She spent most of that day of the Teatro setting up tables and linens, arranging silverware, running serving dishes of food and preparing them for the feast to follow. By the evening, she was exhausted, but helplessly transported by the effects of their work. The hotel, which already had an unreal quality for her, seemed like a shining miracle in the midst of so much darkness and despair.

The miracle wasn't hers to hold and contemplate for long. There was work to do to sustain the miracle, to prop up the illusions of comfort and splendor, of escape. The residents began to fill the scene as well. Once they were there, placed in their positions, there were orders to fill.

For the first few hours, she was so busy attending the residents, that she didn't notice that the boat was missing from the boat house. She only realized that when Max instructed her to start refilling ice from the relocated ice machine. She stood at the machine's gaping, open plastic hatch, letting the cool vapors from the ice swarm over her. But when she turned she almost dropped the large plastic bucket she had been filling.

The boat was gone and that meant that the plan might not work. She had never really thought of the plan as being anything more than a plan, something that existed as an idea only. But seeing the boat gone made her anxious that this thing that only existed as words and vague images in her mind might not work.

For the moment, though, she had to stay focused on her tasks at hand, to remind herself of where she was and what she was doing. Getting distracted now would only draw unwelcome attention to herself. It was clear now that the Teatro had been underway for a while, that the residents were becoming more and more oblivious to her and the other workers. That was a fine thing and probably the way she preferred to keep it.

Not long after discovering that the boat was missing, she could hear a faint droning sound in the distance. The sound grew louder and louder. Once it was loud enough to cut through the sounds of the crowd, people began to notice the sound. A few people pointed to the water and, as if acting with one mind, the whole audience moved closer to the beach and the water to see what was happening.

She stood at the fringe of the large group and could now see what was making the sound. The boat was cutting through the waves, bounded towards them with an ever increasing buzz from the motor.

From where she stood, she couldn't make out exactly who was in the boat, but she could definitely tell that there were two, maybe three, people riding to the shore. But one person in particular caught her attention. There was a person standing in the boat. The standing person seemed to be a woman, but she couldn't place who exactly it was. Since she worked in the lounge, her contact with the female residents had been very limited.

Regardless, she watched the figure's long hair billow in the rushing air around the boat. The figure kept her arms up and outstretched, letting long panels of flowing fabric ripple and whip behind her. The figure was wearing some kind of costume. It reminded her of illustrations from old mythology books. The woman on the boat seemed to be riding from or into mythology.

There was a brief awkward moment as a hidden third passenger on the boat jumped into the disruptive spray caused by the lake's current. This third passenger hauled in the boat further on land, and then stood at the boat's edge, waiting for the driver, who also dropped down and stood by the boat. Together, they helped lower down the figure by her arms, allowing her to ascend from the boat like some of goddess come to visit the mortals.

The crowd parted and then fell in line as she walked through the middle of them and then on towards the temporary stage that had been built on the hotel's verandah. Once the woman reached the stage, two figure, men this time, but dressed in tight fitting clothes that seemed to have branches attached to them, and holding large branches as well, stood beside her. They assumed their positions like trees beside her.

By now, the audience shifted back to the stage area to watch the show. Since no one was demanding drinks from her, she was able to hang back in the dark corners of the crowd, unseen, but watching. As if on cue, four people appeared on stage. They were dressed very differently from one another, suggesting that they represented something, but she couldn't quite tell what.

She knew from their gesture and slow walk that these people were supposed to be survivors. As they approached the women in costume, they fell to their knees before her, holding their hands together tightly as they appealed to this goddess figure for...food, protection, peace. It was still a little unclear to her.

One figure, however, did not knell and supplicate himself. She could tell from the way he held himself that this was [name]. Instead of groveling before the goddess, he remained aloof and seemingly unconcerned by her presence. For her part, the goddess accepting this as a matter of course. Instead, she attended to the other three first.

The first person, she lifted to standing by a fingure under the chin, the person was wrapped in a magenta shawl and instructed to stand by one of the trees. This person began to inspect the trees and act as if he was caring for the tree, pruning it, watering it. The person playing this role seemed completely absorbed by these imaginary tasks.

The second person she instructed to stand had a different fate. She gave this person a woven item that seemed like a cross between a branch and a fan. She guided this person to the other tree. But instead and tending to this tree, this second person idled there, fanning himself with the fan. He even tried to fan the goddess, which she waved away, causing a ripple of laughter in an otherwise enraptured audience.

Finally she approached the third person. This person seemed to be in the worse shape of the four, dressed in tattered rags. The person playing this part started to shake in an exaggerated way, holding his stomach, launching into a chorus of wordless laments, pitching and holding his arms in different strange shapes.

The goddess inspected him and must have deemed him unacceptable. Three new figures, who she had not noticed before, appeared on the stage. These figures wore long flowing black cloaks. They had wooden masks that had been roughly carved and painted white.

The figures in black swirled around the third person, whose lament became louder, then more violent. Arms and legs shot out in extreme angles from the swirl of fabrics. Cries of man were smothered by a deep whooshing sound the figures were making, something between a sucking noise and a ghostly hum.

The limbs disappeared in the swirl. Slowly, progressively, the figures in black and edged towards the back of the stage. When the crisply snapped their cloaks into place, the third figure had disappeared, vanished from the stage.

Whether it was an exile or an execution, the two other people by the trees did not seem to take notice of what was happening on stage. The amateur actors were very convincing in their oblivious avoidance of the staged cries of pain and agony.

The people by the tress become more attentive when the goddess called the fourth figure to the front. The fourth figure wore a simple costume, but it was obviously [name]. Whereas the other actors could have been interchangeable, it was clear that this role was reserved for one person, for [name]. As he approached the goddess, the entire script changed and instead of kneeling to her in supplication or reverence, the goddess kneeled before him. She held out in her hands something shiny,  something that looked with a dagger or knife.

[Name] reached down for it. Held it up for the crowd the see and then proceed to pretend to kill the goddess with the knife. She couldn't compare this year's goddess to other performances, but this year's did seem to draw out the death scene. She ended up cradled in [name's] arms and then expired. He lay the actress' limp body to the ground and stood above her and turned to the crowd in triumph. The crowd cheered and without delay the celebration began again.

She kept watching for the old man, but only ever caught a glimpse of him. And each time she saw him, it wasn't long enough to establish with any meaningful looks if the plan was going to proceed as they had discussed. It seemed like many of the pieces were ready. But for some reason, the old man hesitated and didn't commit. So she had to wait and be ready for the signal that the plan was in motion.

In the meantime, she had to focus on her job. Just as Max had said, the celebration did last late into the night. At some point, though, she couldn't remember when, the revelry shifted inside, meaning that most of the workers shifted inside as well. The party didn't slow down, but continued on in the halls and rooms of the hotel. She could not remember seeing so many revelers all at once.

Even though she could barely keep her eyes open, there was still work to do. Her feet were starting to ache and she was ready to sleep, even if for a few moments only. Max called out to her above the roar of the revelers to get more ice. Since they had not had time to move the machine, she had to go out to the boat house to get it.

Nighttime was just starting to fade into day. The sun was slowly starting to peel away the pieces of night sky, removing stars one by one. She looked out at the water. Its unlit expanse seemed to stretch far and wide and disappear into nothingness. She could image getting swallowed up in that darkness and never appearing again.

Without meaning to, she almost screamed out when someone came up behind her and shuffled her into the boathouse. "Don't scream yet, it's not time," the old man said. She realized that her jumpiness, maybe caused by fatigue, would have set things in motion at the wrong time.

She took a breath and calmed herself. He looked at her and said, "I've been waiting all night for a chance. This is it. We have to take it." She understood and readied herself to execute the plan. He fished out the gun and held it up. He pointed it at the boathouse's opposite wall and fired. The gunshot did startle her, even though she knew it was coming. The sound was deafening in the confined space there were in. Fortunately, the bullet sailed right through the boathouse's siding.

"You watch the door. I'm going to get our stuff," the man said. He disappeared briefly and then was standing next to her with their packs and clothesin his arms. They stood very still and very quiet, waiting for the rush of feet coming to see what the sound was. Listening as intently as she was, she wasn't sure if she was imagining the sound of someone wincing and falling the the ground or not.

She poked her head outside the door and in fact there was someone lying on the ground. She took a few steps forward, realized who it was, and rushed out of the boathouse. "Where are you going?" the old man hissed, not aware of what had happened.

She rushed to the figure's side and confirmed her worse fear. Max lay there, there, shot in the neck, bleeding profusely. She couldn't speak as she looked up at her, but her eyes were full of terror.

She realized, standing over Max, that the older woman, who had treated her so well, in spite of their position in the hotel, was likely going to die. In the old world, an ambulance would have rolled up within minutes and whisked her away to a hospital emergency room. But there were no ambulance and no hospitals.

Just then, the old man whisked up beside her. When Max saw the gun, she tried to grab at her and pull her away from the old man, but she just bled more as a result and winced in pain. "What are you doing," he hissed.

He looked down at Max and the revolver, "Fools luck, I guess. She wasn't supposed to here when I shot the gun. Who could have known. But we have to go...now." He tried to raise her up by her arms, but she batted his hands away and stayed by Max's side.

She felt a profound sense of responsibility for getting Max shot. She couldn't believe that her escape attempt would cost Max her life. And yet here she was, acting out this very scenario. Nothing in the plan said this would happen. But it did happen and now she didn't know what to do.
